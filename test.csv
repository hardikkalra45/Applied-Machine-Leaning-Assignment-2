 hope you are well .  ?  we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book , and  you kindly offered that you would provide this . ? is this still possible ? ? we  realise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ahead and wrote  something , which is below , and if you want to review , change or re - write ? the  preface , that would be very appreciated . ? let me know what your thoughts are .  ?  thanks ,  julie  ( we ' re getting close )  ?  ?  preface  ?  ?  ?  one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives : pricing and risk  management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for  the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible , to discuss  in - depth the models , and to show how they relate to each other . ? in this  way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide  range of energy derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses  a consistent modelling framework . ? we believe that for practitioners this  last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving  arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad - hoc and inconsistent  models for different instruments and markets ( see also others who propose  consistent models ? ) . ? however , it is not our wish to concentrate on one  particular model or models , at the exclusion of the others because we  believe that the choice should rest with the user ( although it will probably  be clear from our discussions the model ( s ) we prefer ) . ? we therefore try and  give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all  the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models  which best suit their needs .  ?  in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model  and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book . ?  in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes  modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing , which are used throughout  the book .  ?  in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices . ? as well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that  can be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of  geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility  and jump processes , discussing each and showing how they can be simulated  and their parameters estimated .  ?  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron corp . , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . ?  this chapter builds on the previous one . ? it examines in detail the methods ,  merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different  pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and  electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative  aspects of calculating volatility .  ?  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . ? although such  curves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial  markets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well  defined curves . ? in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy  prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments . ? we  outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building  forward curves in energy markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric  approach , and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic  factors .  ?  chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses . ? examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as  energy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback  options , and ladder options .  ?  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . ? closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the  models in this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience  yield and interest rate model .  ?  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . ? simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . ? in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . ? this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and  american style options .  ?  chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve . ? the approach  results in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the  evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined  volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . ? closed - form  solutions are developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient  monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . ? the chapter  closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options .  ?  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . ?  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the  problem of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a  portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging  )  illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models . ? the  general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor  hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .  ?  chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk ( var )  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products . ? after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . ? we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma ,  historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same  portfolio of energy options . ? in this chapter we also look at testing the  var estimates for various underlying energy market variables .  ?  finally , in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we  look in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan  ( 1997 ) ) and creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial products ( 1997 ) ) for which  detailed information is publicly available . ? together these provide an  extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk . ? we present  numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives .  ?  before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of  how both the  + tool  , and the market works . ? the techniques we describe are  certainly not  & magic wands  8 which can be waved at data and risk management  problems to provide instant and perfect solutions . ? to quote from the  riskmetrics technical document  &  ( no amount of sophisticated analytics will  replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk .  8 . ? however ,  the right tools , correctly used make the job a lot easier !",0

"Subject: capital book  to further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing enron america ' s velocity of capital and associated return on invested capital , we have decided to create a capital book . the capital book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by joe deffner . the purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within enron americas , with any form of capital requirement , are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge .  the previous numbers used in the business plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets . therefore , on any assets currently held within each business area , the capital charge will remain at 15 % . internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating business unit subject to the internal ownership policy outlined below .  the cost of capital associated with all transactions in enron americas will be set by joe . this process is separate and apart from the current rac process for transactions which will continue unchanged .  capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15 % . transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15 % across the board charge . transactions which are structured off balance sheet , but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on enron america ' s overall credit capacity .  on transactions that deploy capital through the trading books , the capital book will take a finance reserve on each transaction , similar to the way the credit group takes a credit reserve . this finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction . as noted above , the capital book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost .  by sending market - based capital pricing signals internally , enron america ' s sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization .  questions regarding the capital book can be addressed to :  joe deffner 853 - 7117  alan quaintance 345 - 7731",0

"Subject: data for moody ' s riskcalc  craig and kim ,  as you know , i have obtained a 60 day trial subscription to moody ' s riskcalc .  you wanted to know if it makes sense for enron to purchase riskcalc .  well , after plowing through their 100 page manual and sitting through today ' s 2 - hour moody ' s presentation , it is necessary for us to have information about enron ' s counterparties to move to the next step with riskcalc .  we have obtained some information on enron ' s european counterparties from our colleagues in the london office .  we need for you and / or your colleagues in the houston office to supply us with a list of enron ' s north american counterparties .  more specifically , to evaluate moody ' s riskcalc we will need the following financial inputs for enron ' s north american ( private firm ) counterparties :  fiscal year  the prior twelve months of financial data are represented . annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables , such as cost of goods sold , net income , sales , and ebit . the value should be a four - digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or 2000 . forecasts until the year 2009 can be made . a constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last year ' s ( 1999 ) inflation level . in general this ' estimation error ' will not cause any great problems , as size affects default rates at very large scales ( e . g . , $ 10 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 000 , 000 makes a significant difference , $ 1 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 050 , 00 does not ) .  cash & equivalents  this measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities .  inventory  inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet , in thousands dollars , without any alterations for accounting method ( e . g . , lifo , fifo , average cost ) . this item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue . specifically this would include purchase cost , sales cost , sales taxes , transportation costs , insurance costs , and storage costs .  current assets  this item primarily represents cash , inventories , accounts receivables , marketable securities , and other current assets .  total assets  total assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars . for example , $ 15 , 500 , 000 should be entered as 15500 . specifically , total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property , plant , and equipment plus other noncurrent assets ( including intangible assets , deferred items , and investments and advances ) . leave previous year ' s total assets blank for australian companies .  current liabilities  liabilities are positive values . included in current liabilities are short - term debt , accounts payable , and other current liabilities .  total liabilities  this balance sheet account , total liabilities , is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus long - term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities ( including deferred taxes , investment tax credit , and minority interest ) .  retained earnings  retained earnings , a historical measure of performance , is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders . typically , it is the prior year ' s retained earnings plus net income less distributions . retained earnings are generally positive . some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings . leave this field blank for australian companies .  sales  this item consists of the industry segment ' s gross sales ( the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period ) reduced by cash discounts , trade discounts , and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers .  cost of goods sold  entered in thousands of dollars , this value is generally a positive number less than sales . it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production , such as material , labor , and overhead . not fixed overhead or items that would be included in selling , general , and administrative expenses . leave this field blank for australian companies .  ebit  earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation . it can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income .  interest expense  this item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short -

"Subject: alex tartakovski  as you may know , we are trying to schedule an interview for alex tartakovski  in houston this week . i am copying everyone involved because i wont be able  to coordinate this tomorrow . we just brought our new daughter home today and  my wife is yelling at me to get out of my office .  i just found out that thursday & friday are bad days for him , so wednesday is  the only day to do it this week . he would come down tuesday night and fly  out wednesday evening . it ' s probably easiest for him to arrange his flight ,  but he will need a hotel and transportation from the airport . i gave him  donna ' s phone number for help . i assume the hyatt would be best . his home  number is 215 - 702 - 3705 and during the day his cellular is 267 - 981 - 5425 .  by way of background , i plan to bring in 3 people from outside the company to  fill in some of the "" vacants "" in my group ' s org chart . the 3 areas of  specialization that are needed to execute the business plan are ( 1 )  coordination of origination , ( 2 ) deal pricing and underwriting , and ( 3 )  modeling and portfolio management . alex is the perfect person for # 3 . he  has the deepest knowledge of probability of anyone i know and is efficient at  building analysis models , which will be a big job in this business because  portfolio management needs to be redefined in real time due to the lumpiness  of insurance contracts and the lack of any historical methods for evaluating  these risks . development of pricing models will be a joint effort between  "" my "" group and the research dept because this will need to draw on the  expertise in research as well as being a realtime activity as new deals are  being structured . i want to encourage joint work between vasant / amitava  and alex because his background and expertise is compatible with research .  over the past 2 years , alex and i spent a lot of time developing new  electricity spot pricing methodology and this is one area where he excels . i  would expect that he would be a valuable resource in research as well , and so  i would like for him to be able to meet with vince is possible . ( this could  possibly be done when vince is in philadelphia next week if there is time -  ( ? ) ) depending on what work needs to be done in the future , i could see him  working both on pricing research and this specific business unit .  i have attached alex ' s resume . i assume he would be manager level , but i ' m  not sure of this .  this doesnt necessarily come across in the resume , but the skills that are  useful to us are :  probability / statistical model development  development of theoretical pricing methodology  excellent computer programming skills  database development and data analysis  he has the best understanding of the nerc reliability data format outside of  mike curley , the nerc data manager .  designed and wrote the code for the pricing model used by ace power products  for deal pricing and porfolio mgmt .  excellent understanding of options pricing methodology and its application to  hedging insurance portfolios .  if you want to get into superconductor trading , he can design the standards .  can beat me at atari battlezone ( as well as being able to navigate a real  tank through a minefield ) .  one objective of this meeting in houston is to make him feel comfortable with  the organization ( with which you did such a good job for me ) and to give him  confidence that he will be able to do state - of - the - art pricing research in  the most innovative company in the world . he is also interviewing for a job  in morgan stanley ' s equity dept .  we will also arrange a meeting with per in ny , but i would like to be in the  office for that , so we can do that next week .  please call me @ 610 - 996 - 2522 if there are any questions . i may not pick up  but i will reply to voicemail promptly . i ' m up 24 hours this week anyway .  thanks ,  - - dave",0

""  c . the strategy included many elements , including emphasis on the quality  of human resources , changing corporate attitudes to risk taking and employee  empowerment .  d . there are very few companies that match enron ' s experience and  accomplishemnts .  the paper could become a standard reading at the mba courses on corporate  strategy  and would help greatly our recruiting efforts .  writing the paper would require interviews with ken , jeff and a few other key  players .  let me know what you thing about it . john is really excited about this paper .  vince  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by vince j kaminski / hou / ect on 10 / 09 / 2000  08 : 07 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  vkaminski @ aol . com on 10 / 07 / 2000 05 : 29 : 41 pm  to : vkamins @ enron . com  cc :  subject : enron  http : / / www . stanford . edu / group / sia /  stanford india association",0

"Subject: a & a math majors  vince ,  thank you so much for meeting with me friday morning about the research  group .  after leaving your office , i remembered an issue i have had with the analyst  & associate program that might be of interest to you .  during a texas a & m recruiting meeting , i learned that we have expanded our  list of majors to include computer science . i wondered why math majors were  not mentioned , and was told that there was not a business need for math  majors . like liberal arts majors , they said math majors were only considered  on a person by person basis . in my opinion , math majors have many of the  same skills as finance majors , and can easily adjust to accounting rotations  as well ( i did last summer , and finance majors in the program are forced to  every year . ) i think that enron is missing out on many qualified candidates  by limiting their recruitment effort .  at texas a & m the career center asks companies for a list of majors they are  targeting , and only allows those majors to sign up for interviews through the  career center . i sent my resume to enron and asked to be included in the  interview process on campus . however , many other math majors had not heard  of enron or the other companies , and assumed that there was no place for a  math major at a company like enron . many math majors want to continue their  education , become teachers , or work for an actuarial firm . however , many  are undecided . we are constantly told of the many business possibilities  available to math majors by our teachers and staff , but many undergraduates  are still not sure exactly what math majors can contribute in a business  environment . by not mentioning math majors to the career center ( a very  simple and inexpensive step ) , enron is losing out on a very talented pool of  people . while it would be nice to get the math majors that knew about enron  already , had thoroughly researched all companies and determined that math  majors would fit perfectly , and went the extra step to send enron their  resume outside the career center system , there are many qualified students  who do not do this , and opt for other companies who did mention math majors .  i called a manager in the a & a program to suggest that we consider at least  mentioning math majors to the career centers . i realize that it may cost  more to actively pursue them , talk to teachers , and attend math society  events . however , i told her that including them at the career center would  be very inexpensive for enron . she reiterated that they saw no business need  for math majors , and that if more upper level people began requesting them ,  it would be considered . i searched for "" mathematics "" on the enron job  website , and had a surprising number of results . i know that your group  could use math majors as well . however , this still may be too small a number  to merit a focus from the a & a recruiting department . i just wanted to bring  it to your attention in case it was something that you felt should be changed .  thanks ,  heather johnson  x 53240",0

$ 4 . 20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $ 3 . 46 per barrel greater  that the previous five - year average . for the first quarter of 2001 , cera  anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record  high level of $ 4 . 75 per barrel in the first quarter .  * jet / kerosene differentials versus wti rose $ 0 . 63 per barrel from the  october average , reaching a whopping $ 8 . 59 per barrel in november . in  correspondence with the distillate market , jet / kerosene margins are at  historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight  fundamentals . cera expects jet / kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the  first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the  holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of  $ 5 . 75 per barrel .  * margins for us gulf coast 1 % sulfur residual fuel dropped by $ 2 . 15 per  barrel , reaching $ 3 . 99 per barrel below wti during november . despite the  recent widening of differentials , cera expects soaring natural gas prices to  support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter  months . residual fuel differentials are expected to average $ 2 . 50 per barrel  below wti during the first quarter of next year , at the high end of the  historical range .  us demand highlights  * apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0 . 5 million  barrels per day ( mbd ) from the october level , reaching 8 . 36 mbd for the four  weeks ending december 8 . demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last  year largely because y 2 k concerns helped inflate december demand a year ago .  cera anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder  temperatures arrive , averaging 8 . 08 mbd during the first quarter of 2001 .  * reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3 . 94  mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 , over 7 percent greater than this  time last year . this represents a slight increase of about 0 . 05 million  barrels ( mb ) from the end - october level of 3 . 90 mb , but still a record high  level for early december . with support from low home heating oil inventories ,  particularly in the northeast , distillate demand has been very strong during  the fall of 2000 . cera expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter  months , averaging 3 . 79 mb during the first quarter of next year .  * apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the october level  to reach 1 . 68 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 . despite the decline ,  apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year - ago level . the  relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel  distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to  help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals . cera expects the  demand for jet fuel to average 1 . 81 mb during the fourth quarter .  * reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0 . 87 mbd for the four weeks  ending december 8 , a decline of about 0 . 09 mbd from the october average and a  slight increase over the november level . demand for residual fuel is  currently 11 percent greater than last year , and surging natural gas prices  are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout  the winter . residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0 . 85 to 0 . 9 mbd  range during the first quarter of 2001 .  us inventory highlights  * primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196 . 5 mb , increasing  almost 10 mb from the end - october value . responding to rising stock levels  and declining apparent demand , forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to  23 . 5 days for the four weeks ending december 8 . forward supply is 2 . 5 percent  below last year ' s level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the  past eight years - although cera still believes coverage is currently  sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter . however , cera is  looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and  production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the  start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year .  * distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of  october at 29 . 2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 .  despite record high apparent demand , strong refinery production levels helped  boost primary distillate inventories slightly , to 115 . 3 mb for this period .  primary stocks are 16 percent below last year ' s level at this time and at  their lowest historical level ever . although stocks are low , cera does not  anticipate shortages to occur this winter . assuming normally cold weather ,  refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting  demand requirements - albeit at a high price .  * jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage , to  reach 25 . 7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 . this  moves jet fuel coverage above the 23 . 5 to 25 days ' supply range that it had  been in for the past four months . the rise of just under 1 day in forward  supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand . jet inventories  and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull  from tight distillate markets strengthen , but supplies are expected to be  adequate for the winter .  * inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply  from october , reaching 41 . 7 days of forward supply during the four weeks  ending december 8 . the increase in coverage was a temporary response to a  drop in demand and an increase in stocks . with demand expected to strengthen  because of colder weather and high gas prices , cera looks for inventories and  coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks .  * * end * *  this cera alert will be available in pdf format within 24 hours .  this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information  from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

"Subject: the lure of the san  network world fusion focus : amy larsen decarlo  on storage in the enterprise  today ' s focus : the lure of the san  03 / 14 / 00  dear wincenty kaminski ,  today ' s focus : the lure of the san  by amy larsen decarlo  e - business is changing how businesses value information . information  has become a strategic asset that gives companies an edge over their  market rivals . companies use intelligence to identify new markets and  make contact with prospective customers . in this media - saturated era ,  information itself is packaged and sold as a product . this makes the  ability to supply users with fast access to stored information on a  continuous basis absolutely crucial .  companies are clearly coming to a crossroads in their storage  implementations . with estimates for internet storage capacity needs  doubling every three months , it professionals are hungry for a scalable  solution to help them consolidate control of stored information . they  often look to storage - area networks ( san ) as a better option to manage  their information storage systems than distributed models .  today , most organizations rely on a distributed storage model that uses  file servers to process i / o requests from end users and other  application servers . in this model , all requests for data go through  the file server that owns the attached storage disks , and only one file  server can tap data on a particular disk via a scsi bus .  this model has several shortcomings . first , the amount of data a  server can access is restricted to the number of disks supported by the  bus , which limits the capacity of a single file server . second , because  the server processes each i / o request , it risks becoming a bottleneck .  third , this server model carries some daunting availability limitations ,  because only one file server is allowed to access a set of disks . if  that file server or any of its scsi connections fails , then users and  other application servers lose access to the stored files .  this model carries other major disadvantages . distributed file servers  rely on the data transport network to run backup and recovery operations  which can eat up bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions to a  crawl . finally , this decentralized setup is difficult to manage from  both a logical and a physical perspective . file server based storage  systems are distributed throughout the enterprise , so it is often  difficult to assess current and future capacity needs . and because  these servers use a parallel cabling scheme to link the file server to  the disk array , they can also be cumbersome to set up and manage .  sans promise to mitigate the problems that plague conventional file  servers , largely through consolidation of control . these specialized  storage networks claim higher availability , faster performance ,  centralized management , and by their architecture , the capability to  remove bandwidth - intensive data backup and recovery operations from the  lan . this frees up the lan for normal data communications and ensures  smoother back - up operations .  using high - speed transports like fibre channel , sans offer a high -  performance network optimized for moving storage data . sans also make  way for new storage implementations like lan - free backup . and , because  fibre channel can support distances of up to 10 kilometers , san devices  can be widely distributed , but also centrally managed as one network .  yet , as was the case with lans in their younger years , sans are still  developing . vendors are still working out major product interoperability  issues , while companies deploying san technology struggle with how to  merge the very different worlds of storage and networks and manage both  together . ultimately the hope is that , like lans , sans will develop into  a mature and highly manageable solution that supplies substantial  benefits at lower costs .  given that storage deployment and ongoing support costs can total 10  times the acquisition price for the equipment , the consolidated  management capabilities of a san may deliver the biggest benefit to  business .  to contact amy larsen decarlo :  -

"Subject: re : clayton vernon  i have some concerns regarding vernon being able to transfer even if he is  temporarily successful with deliverables defined for him . according to enron  policy , an employee can only transfer if he is in satisfactory standing or  better . this is to prevent problem employees being moved from one  organization to the another . this sounds like a "" work ethic "" issue to me and  the chances that it would continue in another department are great even if he  is temporarily successful . but if kevin presto knows the situation and he  still wants vernon in the end , i will push for an exception as this satisfies  our obligation to be forthright . please keep me informed of clayton ' s  progress as time goes on so we do not get criticized for passing on a problem  employee . thanks .  sheila  vince j kaminski  07 / 28 / 2000 08 : 35 am  to : kevin m presto / hou / ect @ ect  cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , sheila walton / hou / ect @ ect , vasant  shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect  subject : clayton vernon  kevin ,  vasant and i talked to clayton about his request for transfer . clayton  received a conditional approval contingent  upon completion of the current project he works on . vasant will formulate  exact definition of the deliverables  and we will hold clayton to it . if he fails to deliver the request for  transfer will be rejected . anything else  would be highly demoralizing to everybody .  clayton has so far produced exactly zero ( no single output was delivered )  though he was advertising  the projects inside and outside the group as completed . i want you to be  aware of it , because i have  serious doubts regarding clayton ' s integrity .  vince",0

"Subject: urgent response  dear sir / madam ,  you may be surprised to receive this letter from me , since you don ' t know me personally . i am mrs maria da costa the wife of dr . john da costa , who was recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe , i got your contact through network on line in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of a fund to a foreign account and i decided to write you . my late husband was among the zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president robert mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority . before his death he deposited the sum of us $ 15 . 2 million ( fifteen million two hundred thousand us dollars ) to south africa with a security company as if he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe .  the money was deposited in a din box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the security company . this money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and establishment of new farms in lesotho and swaziland . the land problem arose when president robert mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the "" modus operandi "" adopted by the government .  this resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs , precisely ; more than fifty - one ( 51 ) people have so far been killed . heads of governments from the west , especially britain and united states of america have voiced their condemnation of mugabe ' s plan , subsequently , south african development community ( s . a . d . c . ) has continuously supported mugabe ' s new land act , it is against this background that i and my  family who are currently residing in south africa have decided to transfer my husband ' s money into a foreign account . as a family , i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account , where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who is tactically freezing of our family wealth .  and south africa ' s government seems to be playing along with them . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in south africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history . more so , the south african foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an "" asylum "" . as a business person whom i would entrust my future and that of my family into his hands , i must let you know that this transaction is 100 % risk free and that the nature of your business does not necessarily matter .  for your assistance , i will offering you 15 % of the total sum , 80 % for my family while 5 % will be mapped out for any expenses we may incur during the course of this transaction . i wish to  invest our part of the money on commercial property based on your advice .  finally , all i demand from you is assurance that you will not do away with this money when it finally gets to your personal or company ' s account in your country .  if this proposal is acceptable by you , please confirm your interest by contacting us on this phone number + 27724263169 or e - mail address mariadacosta _ 2002 @ yahoo . com  best regards ,  mrs maria da costa ( for the family )",1

"Subject: re : hdaf seminar topics  folks :  i have tentatively set the date for our first round - table discussion for  wednesday ,  december 20 th at 3 : 00 pm - 4 : 30 pm . the room , eb 3268 , will be available from  3 : 00 to 5 : 00 pm . if any of you have an issue with the date , please let me  know by  day ' s end .  professor don kouri of the physics department of the university of houston  will start  with an informal 30 - 45 minute presentation ( see appended abstract below ) of  his work  and will then lead a discussion as well answer questions that we may have .  professor kouri , please let me know if you have any requirements for  audiovisual  or other equipment .  this excerpt from a previous correspondence provides an insight to the  subject of our meeting :  [ . . . ] topics to  be discussed at a small ` ` roundtable ' ' format meeting , are :  1 . hdafs for data analysis , including ` ` gap - filling ' ' , data  extrapolation , denoising , mathematical manipulations of digital  data ( e . g . , taking derivatives , applying functions of differential  operators to digital data , etc . )  2 . hdafs as the basis of numerical algorithms for solving nonlinear  partial differential equations , particularly for equations for which  existing methods encounter stability problems .  there are certainly other areas of interest and applications of the  hdafs but i think that even trying to do both of the above in a  single meeting would be difficult . of course , in this first meeting  we would focus on general aspects of the hdafs that make them robust  for such applications . if , however , you have other topics in which  you are interested , i am willing to focus on them .

"Subject: re : status  clayton ,  we can discuss your request when i come back to the office on monday .  regarding the trip to portland . such a trip requires an explicit prior  permission from your boss ,  myself in his absence , or stinson in my and vasant ' s absence .  in case you did not ask for such a permission before , the request is denied .  vince  clayton vernon @ enron  07 / 20 / 2000 03 : 12 pm  to : vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect  cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  subject : status  vasant -  i hope you had a wonderful vacation back home , and are rested and recovered  from the long flight back .  i wanted to give you an update of the eol project , the gas model , and of my  intentions here at enron .  software ( in compiled c on the unix platform ) has been developed and debugged  to listen to the eol trades , process them , book them , and file them away . in  addition , software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on  a continual basis , and to store the entirety of open positions on eol in a  dynamic matrix facilitating analysis . it has yet to get back with me on how  the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit  purposes .  these data files are stored in a format for reading by excel or by sas , for  which i have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines  elucidating the structure of the data .  i am in the process of documenting all of this for you .  with regards the gas model and its slow performance on the compaq , dell has  agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the compaq , to see if  the performance issue of the lp is related to the compaq . i have been  researching this issue with it here and with compaq and dell . the new machine  will be here any day now ( no financial obligation to anyone ) , and i will be  able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is  compaq - specific .  i am also in the process of documenting the gas model for you .  i ' ve tried to do my best for you , vasant , but i have been frustrated by not  only the death of my mother but some internal systems in it here . just the  other day , sas could not open a full query of the eol database because there  wasn ' t enough free space on the server ' s hard drive for the workfiles . in  discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power  trading , people whom i have known for over 10 years , they indicated they were  ubiquitous here . the power traders have similar pc ' s to my new one , and they  have complained from day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones . also ,  there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses ;  during my brief tenure here it has gone through two differing proposals as to  how to address this . when i have been told of tools available for real - time  data harvesting , my requests for such have typically been met with "" well , we  have it , but we haven ' t really tested it yet . "" an example is the weather : we  still do not record to disk the hourly nws observations from the goes  satellite .  my interests here are to help enron to do well , because i will do well only  if enron does well . these aren ' t empty words - my ira is 100 % invested in the  enron stock fund . i believe my best contributions to enron will be in the  areas of systems as well as modeling , and the difficulty working in the  research group , in terms of systems development , is that , frankly , few people  at enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems . we aren ' t  directly generating revenues for enron , and we aren ' t really their customers ,  except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses .  as it happens , power trading posted an opening for a modeling and forecasting  person , and i spoke with them and they asked me to take the job , reporting to  george hopley . it is a wonderful opportunity for me , vasant , as they are  interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their  traders ' access to real - time fundamentals data . i was completely candid with  kevin presto regarding my shortcomings here in research - i told him you were  disgusted with me because i repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines . they  also understand i have yet to be at enron for 1 year , and thus may only bid  on a job with your permission . we agree the move is good for enron ; we all  work for enron , and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but  merely permit it . they are comfortable with me - they have known me for years  as a hard worker , honest and unpretensive . they have already ordered a  state - of - the - art unix workstation and server for me , and they have told me  they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful ,  including hiring an analyst to work for me . and , i have already been able to  teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis i  have learned here .  so , i am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening . it would be  a lateral move in position and salary , and i would commit to you to help you  in any way possible in the future with regards the gas model or the eol  database . i will continue to work on their improvement , and complete their  documentation .  as it happens , i am away on enron business in portland monday and tuesday ,  and will be back wednesday . i had wanted to talk face - to - face instead of by  email , but enron business supercedes - i am on a team designing the data  warehouse for floor trader support .  clayton .",0

"Subject: erisk interview  vince :  you may inteersted in the following interview which appeared on erisk . com last friday . were rick buy ' s comments about real options taken out of context ?  yann bonduelle leads a 25 - person team for in london  that applies decision analytics and real options theory to dilemmas ranging from  valuing a biotechnology product to deciding whether to kill off an internet financial  services business . here he talks to rob jameson about whether this "" theoretical ""  approach to risky decision - making really helps businesses in their day - to - day  balancing of risk and reward . yann holds a ph . d degree from the  engineering - economic systems department at stanford university , where he  studied how to apply engineering decision and design analysis to wider economic ,  social and business issues . he then worked as a consultant applying his decision  analysis methodologies to problems that included consumer decision making  about innovative products such as electrical vehicles , before joining the   team in 1998 where he is now a partner . he has  written widely on the application of real options , particularly in fields of life  sciences , technology , and e - business , and has a special interest in the  relationship between risk assessment , validation of risk data and financial  valuation .  how would you sum up your approach to business decision analytics ?  most of our projects are set up to help businesses that face massive uncertainties  of some kind . decision analysis helps people explore problems , and redesign  their decision - making process to increase the chance of them making the right  choices . for example , imagine a biotechnology company that has to decide  whether to put itself up for sale , enter a strategic relationship , or continue to go it  alone . each of those options will lead on to other value - enhancing or  value - destroying scenarios . we work with the client firstly to understand and  challenge the assumptions associated with their most likely business  development scenarios , and secondly to help them identify decisions that would  help protect or increase the value of their technology or company . quantifying  technical , regulatory or commercial risks can sometimes be a challenge . in  technology - intensive fields , however , we have found that managers ( often  scientists ) are quite willing to describe the main sources of risk and to assess the  probability that a risky event may or may not occur .  how does this kind of risky decision - making relate to real options valuation ?  you can ' t say what the value of an asset is until you decide what you might use it  for . this means that , to form an opinion about the value of an asset , you must  explore the most important decisions that you are likely to face and that will have  a significant impact on the value of the asset . so decision analysis helps to define  the business problem and to uncover a stream of inter - related choices that are , in  effect , "" real options "" . for example , if a company is trying to decide whether to  invest in a risky project , does it have the option to pull the plug on the investment  at an early stage if a pilot project gives a poor showing ? that "" real "" option reduces  the riskiness , and increases the potential value , of the original business plan . so  real options and decision analysis are really very close to one another . but you  don ' t have to believe in real options valuations to find decision analysis useful .  what do you mean ?  often decision analysis can help managers to identify the key risks in a strategic  decision , attach weights to these , and show clearly how they interact . for many  companies this "" risk discovery "" is the most valuable part of the exercise .  real options theory has been criticised recently for being , well , not very realistic .  is it a practical approach to valuation ?  it ' s important not to hold out unrealistic hopes for the real options approach to  valuation . but it ' s an exciting methodology , and it ' s also sometimes the only  reasonable way of tackling a very practical problem . for example , when a firm  sells an asset , the firm might have to make an independent valuation of the asset  for legal or corporate governance reasons . but in many businesses today there  are assets that simply cannot be valued in traditional ways because they are  difficult to link to cashflows . the cashflows might not exist because the business  is so novel , or they might be hidden . in some respects , a real options analysis is  much closer to reality than a traditional valuation .  how , exactly ?  the classic way of valuing a future business is to base the calculation on a single  discounted cashflow that is projected from the activity . but this doesn ' t really take  account of the way that scenarios can change , or the fact that managers can  react to situations as they unfold . i mentioned earlier the option to kill a project or  business at an early point . but the upside is that if a pilot project yields exciting  results , it might allow you to invest more quickly and reach a revenue - generating  position in a much shorter time than the original business plan allows . so to value  a future business we really need to look at the cashflows that might arise in a  number of scenarios . this is "" realistic "" in that , if the project gets the green light ,  you can bet that its managers will be taking that kind of decision on the ground all  of the time .  what ' s the most challenging part of mapping out a decision analysis tree ?  modelling the links between the variables in the decision tree - - it ' s something we  have particular strengths in . but it ' s also tricky to know when it ' s worthwhile to  add on more detail , and when it ' s better to draw back .  in a recent erisk interview , rick buy , chief risk officer of enron , said that over  the two years that enron had experimented with the real options concept , it had  found it of "" limited , but not zero , use "" . why is there a slight air of cynicism about  real options in some businesses today ?  it ' s strange that enron would profess this attitude . a few years ago , it was widely  reported to have used real option valuation to support a very profitable purchase  decision . they had apparently bought cheaply some older generators in the us  that generated electricity at a very high cost . they knew that they could mothball  them for most of the year , and switch them on only when the electricity prices  were sufficiently high . nevertheless , from a customer ' s point of view , there might  have been too much hype about the methodology . one problem in the application  of real options technology is that there are , perhaps , too many people trying to  tweak reality to conform to their "" perfect "" model . it ' s better to aim for something  pragmatic that clearly improves decisions over time . in one pharmaceutical  company we worked with recently , we worked together to improve their valuation  analyses by moving from a single discounted cash - flow methodology to one that  took into account a rather small set of business scenarios . it would have shocked  some academics and consultants , but it was an undeniable improvement on the  original approach .  why do you think financial institutions are only just picking up on your field , when  it ' s been applied in the energy industry for 15 years or more ?  it might have something to do with the relative stability of the banking world until  recently , and the relatively high margins that banking lines have enjoyed . also ,  industries such as energy and pharmaceuticals tend to have more people with an  engineering and science background . the dynamic modelling of decisions is  based on methodologies originally dreamed up to help engineers design electrical  and electronic systems . this approach is quite distinct from the black - scholes  options analyses that the banking world is familiar with : the black - scholes  approach is difficult to apply in a real options context , because everything  depends on the assumptions that you put into the black - scholes model . the real  options approach , on the other hand , is in a sense a way of modelling those  assumptions more explicitly . but banks are now adopting some of the thinking ,  particularly in terms of using decision analysis to pinpoint risks and identify  value - enhancing decisions , and in using real options methodologies to sort the  wheat from the chaff in their more speculative investments .  you mean their internet investments ?  we have recently worked with a major dutch bank that had arrived late in the  internet game , and then made a considerable number of investments . now that  even b 2 b business models have questions marks hanging over them , and many  b 2 c businesses are already under water , they wanted to work out which  investments might contain real value . in this situation , it ' s a case of ranking  priorities and helping the bank make sense of what could turn into a  decision - making chaos , rather than sophisticated valuation . it ' s not just a case of  whether an internet investment should be killed off , but the problem of whether  continued funding for it should take priority over budget demands for major it  upgrades in existing businesses , and so on . these are very practical questions  and they have to be answered somehow .  are there other areas in financial institutions that seem accessible to this  approach ?  yes , for example , we think it can help work out the value associated with various  approaches to marketing a new bank business line . at the moment , many banks  are chasing high - net - worth individuals , but it ' s not always clear which kind of  individual a particular bank should decide to pursue . the bank might have a  regional or industry advantage already in one particular area , for example , music  business people . but what is the churn rate associated with this kind of  customer ? what is the profitability associated with the customer segment ? will  the time and cost benefits of the advantages the bank has in the sector outweigh  any disadvantages ? weighing up this kind of complex problem , where one thing  leads to and depends on another , is what decision and real options analysis is  good at .  is there any way of rigorously backtesting or validating real options valuations ?  in all honesty , not really . the problem is that by the time the option is exercised ,  many of the variables surrounding it will have changed , so it ' s difficult to compare  our original analysis with how things turn out . however , the value of the analysis  comes not only from the final number ( "" the value of this asset is x "" ) but also from  providing a thorough process , an outsider ' s point of view , an understanding of the  sources of value and , in short , a bit of clearer thinking .  if real options are so important , why are they so rarely cited in communications to  shareholders and equity analysts ?  the battle is still to convince companies to use real option valuations as a  significant part of their internal analysis . even in major companies in the oil & gas ,  and pharmaceutical sectors , where the ideas have taken some root internally ,  there seems to be a lot of reluctance to use them in external communication . we  are working with analysts to understand better what they need to if we are to move  things on to the next step .  how does the riskiness of a business , in terms of the major strategic dilemmas it  faces , relate to its share value , and its capital structure ?  that ' s a big question . it ' s related to work my colleagues do on the optimal  debt - to - equity capital structure and gearing of a corporation , which in turn arises  out of the likely revenue and cost volatilities of the business . the more volatile the  business , the less gearing it can sustain , and the higher the cost of capital . our  work touches on this in the sense that exercising ( many ) specific real options can  allow a firm to change its nature , and thus also its risk profile . one classic  example is the pharmaceutical industry . a host of different kinds of companies  service that industry from "" big pharma "" companies through to smaller  biotechnology startups and run - of - the - mill contract research organisations . a  contract research organisation is often operating within a very competitive  environment with relatively few risks - - it does not invest in drug development itself  - - but also very thin margins . but in fact , a few of these companies have used the  skills and knowledge they have developed to become much more substantial and  profitable healthcare companies of various kinds . it ' s an example of a company  exercising the real options that lie within its skills and assets to transform its own  identity .  rob jameson , erisk",0

"" these are very large operations and to some extent they can bear  some risks , "" says pawel kaminski , energy - sector operations officer at  the world bank in warsaw . "" but eventually they have to generate some  return . ""  enron pioneered wholesale gas and electricity trading in the u . s . it  entered europe in 1989 , setting up in london as the u . k . ' s energy sector  liberalized . it entered the nordic market in 1996 , and today is the nord  pool ' s largest - volume trader .  enron says it takes about two years to find a site and obtain permits  for a power plant , and a further 29 months for construction .  just four years after entering the u . k . , enron finished its  1 , 875 - megawatt teesside plant . teesside ' s capacity and cost , at gbp 795  million ( 1 . 32 billion euros ) , are many times larger than nowa sarzyna ' s .  yet teesside was completed in only two - thirds the time . the company  declines to compare development times in various countries .  "" i wouldn ' t necessarily put poland into the same category as russia , ""  says philip davies , regulatory and government - affairs manager at enron  europe in london . "" but obviously , given poland ' s ( planned economy ) past ,  it probably takes a bit longer to work through the regulatory process  and get to the starting point . ""  at nowa sarzyna , it took enron nearly twice the usual time to reach  the starting point , even though mr . astramowicz already knew the site ,  and the polish power industry ' s rules .  the nowa sarzyna plant was mr . astramowicz ' s brainchild , and he  burned out the engine in his first bmw as he traveled between warsaw and  the town to craft the deal . a freelance energy - sector entrepreneur  before joining enron , mr . astramowicz sold his interest in nowa sarzyna  to enron in 1998 .  enron has spent $ 132 million to build nowa sarzyna , a 116 - megawatt ,  gas - fired combined heat - and - power plant . quiet , clean and efficient , the  plant stands in stark contrast to most of poland ' s belching , coal - fired  behemoths . when it starts up this month , it will sell its electricity to  the polish power grid , the country ' s high - voltage network , under a  20 - year power - purchase agreement , or ppa , that enron won in 1997 . steam  output goes to organika , the chemical company next door , and helps heat  the town of nowa sarzyna .  the nowa sarzyna plant is more than 80 % financed by commercial - bank  loans for which the only collateral is the plant ' s concluded contracts .  "" they were betting on their good name , "" says michael davies , a  partner with allen & overy , the warsaw law firm that advised enron  poland ' s lenders . "" they are pushing envelopes all the time . ""  that is especially true in a market with 30 % overcapacity , where an  energy law didn ' t even exist until 1997 .  says peter bisztyga , emerging europe utilities analyst at solomon  smith barney in london : "" because enron signed a ppa , they are ok . . .  ( but ) i ' m really not sure building nowa sarzyna was such a good idea . ""  mr . bisztyga says enron could have generated a faster return by  renovating an existing power plant . but , he acknowledges , nowa sarzyna  "" allowed enron to get into the polish market early and stamp their name  on it . ""  in 1994 , polish power plants weren ' t for sale . energy asset  privatization , discussed for years , began in earnest only this year . by  2002 , the polish government proposes to sell off stakes in dozens of  power plants , 33 distribution companies and the polish power grid , a  12 , 000 - kilometer national transmission network of high - voltage lines .  the assets have a total book value of 33 billion zlotys ( 8 . 4 billion  euros ) , but murky regulations have driven prices down .  "" the regulations don ' t promote competition and so you don ' t really  know the price of electricity , "" says bengt wegemo , president of  vattenfall poland . earlier this year , vattenfall paid $ 235 million for  55 % in warsaw - based elektrocieplownie warszawskie , promising $ 340  million in investment in the heat - and - power plant over the next 10  years .  investors hope the new power market will bring clarity over pricing .  ultimately , 170 licensed energy traders and 200 large power users will  trade on the bourse , setting the wholesale price of electricity . the  polish bourse will be modeled on its nordic counterpart . enron , the nord  pool ' s largest trader , hopes to post polish trading profits by 2001 .  but first , say market experts , poland ' s 1997 energy law must be  amended to ease functioning of the bourse , and free up access to  poland ' s distribution network .  further , the government says it must solve the competition problem  posed by the polish power grid ' s power - purchase agreements , which  account for 70 % of energy sales in poland . some state - owned plants used  the agreements as collateral to secure modernization financing . when  prices are freed , these plants might go bankrupt if forced to compete  with plants that didn ' t spend money to modernize .  the government is contemplating a special fund to compensate the  modernized plants for their extra costs . though nowa sarzyna is a  private plant , the price enron must charge for its power is about twice  what outmoded plants charge .  "" we are hoping that continuous , efficient operation of the plant will  generate us a ( bigger ) profit , "" mr . astramowicz says .  another problem is cross - border power trading , where contradictory  legislation essentially gives a monopoly to the polish power grid , also  known as pse . enron and others protest that pse shouldn ' t compete with  electricity - market participants who contract with it for transmission  service .  pse intends to stay in the trading business , says marek zerka , pse ' s  vice president . in late march , pse and local company kulczyk holding  signed an agreement with preussenelektra ag of germany to export  electricity and coal to eu countries via germany .  "" this is great news , "" mr . astramowicz says . "" if this joint venture  gets access to pse ' s cross - border transmission capacity . . . i would  expect pse to confirm open access to all market participants . ""  enron and others are pushing hard for that access . "" as soon as the  market becomes open , free and non - discriminatory , we will come out at a  decent profit , "" mr . astramowicz says .  folder name : enron in europe  relevance score on scale of 100 : 78  to review or revise your folder , visit http : / / www . djinteractive . com or  contact dow jones customer service by e - mail at custom . news @ bis . dowjones . com  or by phone at 800 - 369 - 7466 .

""  2 . debt restructuring - guarantees , but no direct state money  davis also told the videoconference that he believes the $ 12 billion in back  debt owed by the utility companies can be cleared up  during a 90 - day forbearance period ( whether that period has been agreed to by  all creditors is not something we are clear about right now ) . davis ' idea , as  he laid it out in the meeting , is to use the forbearance period to securitize  the debts and sell them against the utilities ' forward rate base or by  establishing a  medium - term repayment plan backed by continued state guarantees .  in both cases the restructured debt would be resolved over a decade without  direct use of taxpayer money as the utilities use their positive margins to  paydown their debt . one of the reasons davis wants to stay close to the  $ 50 - $ 55 megawatt charge is that it maximizes the rate at which utilities can  pay  down this debt . there is a strong chance that davis will agree to use state  guarantees to sweeten the pot at the end of these negotiations , but he remains  opposed to using direct state money . this frustrates both clinton  administration and utility creditors , but davis has not yet shown much  flexibility .  3 . eminent domain / reregulation  perhaps most frustrating to the washington dc free market crowd at treasury  and the white house was the continued comfort davis and his group of political  advisers have with "" non - market "" solutions to the energy crisis . although  the governor ' s aides actually believe the weapon is more a "" way to force  eventual  agreement , than an actual solution , "" the talk returns frequently to these  non - market mechanisms . "" we have the ultimate weapon to enforce compliance by  the  tuesday deadline . if we make no progress . if this thing looks like it will  turn into a genuine crisis , then we will use our powers of condemnation and  we will re - take  the plants and equipment and run them ourselves , "" a close political aide to  davis said . "" we will absorb the plants , the transmission lines and the  reserved parking  places of the executives . the legislature would agree in a second . """,0

"Subject: alliance info alert - ferc reporting  attached is a summary of recent ferc activities ( pdf file ) and the weekly  alliance express . the following is a summary of the most recent ferc meeting ,  followed by a listing of the most recent ferc filings .  in a brief meeting yesterday , ferc approved a final rule adopting section 203  merger filing requirements , generally as proposed , and extended the existing  nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time that the new york market can be  determined to be "" workably competitive . "" at the same time , ferc ordered a  technical conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and  urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next  steps , and deadlines for resolution / implementation . additional details are  provided below .  ferc updates , streamlines merger filing process  ferc unanimously approved its proposed order revising the reporting  requirements for mergers . however , comm . hebert did so with reservations , as  discussed below . commission staff stated that the order closely follows the  notice of proposed rulemaking previously issued , but adds more detail and  more certainty to the industry . staff stated that the order is improved over  the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain  entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products .  according to ferc , the draft order :  - revises the commission ' s filing requirements to reflect existing merger  policy based on ferc ' s 1996 merger policy guidelines ;  - provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market  analyses . the rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with  potential horizontal competitive concerns . in addition , the rule establishes  informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses .  - streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise  competitive concerns ; and  - reduces the industry ' s regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing  requirements .  the rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the federal  register .  commissioner reaction :  comm . hebert expressed reservations that , although he was voting for the  rule , ferc should not be duplicating the department of justice ( doj ) and the  federal trade commission ( ftc ) market concentration analyses and that ferc  should follow the lead of anti - trust enforcement officials , who could also  analyze mergers faster and more confidentially . he also stated that ferc  should review the filings after the doj or the ftc review them , not before ,  and that there should be a definite time frame for review . hebert did  mention that he was pleased that rtos and the disposition of transmission  assets would be exempt , that ancillary services would be considered as a  separate product and that the final rule opens the door for alternative  market analysis .  comm . breathitt supported the final rule , stating that it should expedite the  approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the  fact that older , irrelevant requirements have been dropped . she indicated  that the final rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting  the public interest by stating that the process will be "" efficient yet  sufficient "" . the commissioner said that she was pleased the final rule  addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail  competition and one of her main concerns , confidentiality .  comm . massey fully supported the final rule , emphasizing that it would  improve response time , lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the  industry to better predict commission actions . like commissioner breathitt ,  massey was pleased that the order will allow market modeling analysis that  will better enable ferc to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants  to point to other factors when concentration appears too high . massey also  stated that the new rule includes the ability to address many of ferc ' s  concerns , such as future mergers when they occur in succession , retail  competition , mitigation by the enlargement of markets through rtos and  analysis of ancillary services . in sum , he averred that the order will  provide ferc with the tools it needs for accurate analysis , while taking into  consideration the rapid changes in the industry .  chairman hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was  a very important rule . in response to comm . hebert , chairman hoecker said  that the doj and ftc actually wait for ferc ' s report before issuing their  own , that the anti - trust enforcement agencies rely on ferc ' s expertise when  reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries . there is a major  positive connection between industry consolidation and rtos and that both are  reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work , he noted . because the  rtos enlarge the size of the subject market , he indicated , rtos will help to  preserve competition . therefore , more and larger rtos should allow for more  mergers , he said . the chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that  joining an rto is a requirement for a merger , but that it would certainly be  viewed favorably .  nyiso bid caps extended until ancillary service market shown to be workably  competitive  in a 3 - 1 decision , with comm . hebert dissenting , ferc extended the existing  nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be  "" workably competitive . "" at the same time , ferc ordered a technical  conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and urged market  participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next steps , and  deadlines for resolution / implementation .  in so doing , ferc rejected certain aspects of nyiso ' s september 1 and 8 , 2000  compliance filing , submitted pursuant to its may 31 , 2000 order imposing a  temporary bid cap through october 31 . the iso ' s efforts to correct market  flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had  not yet satisfied the commission ' s directives , ferc concluded . ferc found  that while nyiso has achieved solid progress in certain areas , overall the  iso has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then  gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the iso ' s non - spinning reserve  market by april 2001 , as the iso requested .  commissioner reaction :  comms . hoecker , massey and breathitt all endorsed the order as an "" imperfect  solution , "" yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the  iso ' s market . comm . hebert faulted the commission for squandering an  opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls .  hoecker and breathitt joined hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack  of the iso ' s progress , but contended that significant outstanding issues must  be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted .  in other action , ferc accepted nyiso ' s and nepool ' s proposed emergency energy  transaction agreement , allowing nyiso and iso - ne to provide emergency service  to each other ( ero 0 - 3638 - 000 ) ;  stricken items included cae - 16 ( nepool ' s 64 th agreement amendment proposing  the elimination of in service and instituting new rules governing certain  import transactions ( ero 0 - 3577 - 000 ) ) .  = = recent ferc filings = =  ( 1 ) rto developments  * iso ne submitted its changes to market rule 17 , market monitoring ,  reporting and market power mitigation , in compliance with the commission ' s  july 26 , 2000 order . erol - 368 - 000 . filed november 1 , 2000 .  * iso ne submitted its special interim market rule in compliance with the  commission ' s july 26 , 2000 order . ero 0 - 369 - 000 . filed november 1 , 2000 .  * illinois industrial energy consumers filed to intervene regarding dynegy ' s  filing to request approval for the withdrawal of the illinois power co . from  the miso . erol - 123 - 000 . filed november 6 , 2000 .  * el segundo power filed a motion "" requesting order on request for rehearing  by date certain "" in complaint that challenges the ca iso ' s ability to set the  rates for the energy that it can compel generators to produce for reliability  under its standard form contract . ero 0 - 1830 - 001 . filed november 3 , 2000 .  * ca iso filed an unbundled grid management charge in order to recover its  administrative and operating costs . erol - 313 - 000 . comments due by november  22 , 2000 .  * nepool submitted supplemental information related to its filing of the  sixty - fourth agreement amending the nepool agreement , which proposed the  elimination of in service . ero 0 - 3577 - 000 . comments due by november 14 , 2000 .

"" he noted that the only reason they haven ' t yet is that "" they were too stupid to ring - fence the parent "" and that "" their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it . ""  he added that the davis / socal mou is dead and that all the "" plan b ' s "" are "" speculative "" at best . he also thought that socal was being "" naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court . ""  2 . bond issuance - $ 12 b not enough  angelides conceded that a $ 12 b bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $ 18 - 24 b . the only reason they didn ' t issue more is that angelides felt that "" $ 12 b was all the market could handle . "" the current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $ 400 / mwh , which angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from state comptroller ' s kathleen connell ' s office .  3 . new generator construction  anglelides was explicit that the california public power authority ( authorized by the legislature last week ) will "" build plants and not stop until we [ california ] has a 10 - 15 % capacity cushion above expected demand . angelides expects the state to be "" 5 - 10 % short on power all summer .

"Subject: non - firm power curve building  hi vince ,  amitava and i have received a request to build a non - firm power curve for  each region from david hoog ' s double trigger folks . the objective , as they  explain it , is to allow the desk to buy non - firm from the market , buy david ' s  outage product , and sell firm to the market . accountants would like a curve  to mark the non - firm position .  my initial thought is that the desk should provide this non - firm curve , but  it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they  have put the ball in david hoog ' s court to build the curve if david wants to  sell his product internally to the desk .  assuming we build the curve , the next issue is how to define "" non - firm "" ?  the only way i can think of is to tie the non - firmness to a specific  generation unit or group of units . this will allow the purchase of david ' s  outage product to cover the non - firmness risk . tying the definition of  non - firmness to a whole region seems implausible - - - what does it mean to  give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem  anywhere in the region ? consequently , the non - firm curve takes on a  unit - level interpretation , and not a region - level interpretation .  consequently , i do not see how we can talk about the "" non - firm curve for the  region "" ? we will need to build a non - firm curve for each generation unit or  group of units .  maybe i could get your thoughts later today .  thanks ,  vasant",0

"Subject: re : eprm article  chris ,  this is very well written and will serve the reader well . a few comments .  1 . when i think about the taxonomy of the var models , i typically use the  classification based on 3 categories :  a . variance / covariance method  b . historical simulation  c . monte carlo simulation .  delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear  instrument .  2 . i would define monte carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation  of behavior of  all the market prices / rates , etc . , and revaluation of the entire portfolio .  the revaluation may be based on an approximation ( using taylor ' s expansion )  that may  involve delta , delta / gamma , delta / gamma / omega or may be exact ( based on the  same  model that produces the mark - to - market portfolio valuations ) .  the main benefit of using the mc simulation in the energy markets is the  ability to capture  the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way . i would  emphasize that  there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the v / c model ( i shall send you  the references  from home ) .  3 . i would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets  that are evolving  quickly ( new instruments for which we have no comparable prices ,  behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de - mature ) .  4 . for bigger portfolios , virtually all methods require some level of  aggregation into  atomic , elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem .  this process may be a source of a big error .  5 . the computational burden of mc can be reduced through clever preprocessing  of a portfolio that introduces no error . many swaps with the same underlying  can be aggregated into one positions ( they are portfolios of forwards and  they are linear  instruments ) .  please , feel free to use any comment ( or none ) .  vince  "" chris strickland "" on 08 / 28 / 2000 02 : 58 : 56 pm  please respond to "" chris strickland ""  to :  cc :  subject : eprm article  dear vince ,  ?  d you think you might be able to look at this in the next day or so ? robin  is after something by the end of this week .  ?  best regards .  ?  chris .  ?  - eprm _ 01 _ var . doc",0

"Subject: re : convergence of the research model  i was curious about the accuracy of our credit reserve model as a function of  the  number of simulations we use . this question , i think , is not so important  when we  calculate credit reserve , because the assumptions underlying our model are  pretty  rough anyway ( here i mean the assumptions regarding price processes ,  correlations , etc . )  this question becomes more essential when we talk about calculating  sensitivities of the  credit reserve to various factors . when the magnitude of the sensitivity is  comparable  to the accuracy of calculation of the credit reserve , what is the accuracy of  such sensitivity ?  i performed a numerical experiment where i calculated the expected loss  for a simple portfolio with one counterparty ( sithe ind power ) for different  number of simulations ( 10 , 100 , 1000 , 10000 , 100000 ) using old research  credit model .  you can see how the result converges and the relative error ( compared to the  result for 100000 simulations which is assumed to be the most accurate ) in  the  attached file .  tanya .",0

"Subject: california update 4 / 27 / 01  the following report contains confidential and sensitive information . please treat with discretion .  executive summary :  ? ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives . politically , bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis ; from an economic perspective , he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation  ? davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan , most notably its exclusion of out - of - state generators  ? june lst "" kill clause "" for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional plan  ? california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade , expected $ 20 billion power bill this summer - - economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement  ? qf bid for advance payments from pg & e likely to fail in bankruptcy court  ? new generation delays probable because of state / qf squabbling  ? consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout deal  1 . ferc fallout  the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks like action , but is not . rather , it allows the situation in california to continue to develop virtually unabated . the political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape shouldering the blame . once they are politically inoculated , the administration can begin to look at regional solutions . moreover , the administration has already made explicit ( and will certainly restate in the forthcoming cheney commission report ) its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation .  it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan .  2 . something less than effective price caps  from davis ' s point of view , the ferc plan has four major flaws :  ? the order applies only to california , not to the rest of the west . non - california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to california .  ? as the order is written , it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling .  ? state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system , because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion .  ? even when the price caps kick in , they are based on the cost - plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap . the generators can also charge above the cap , provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc .  3 . proposal "" kill clause "" adds to the political dilemma for davis  the ferc proposal includes a "" kill clause "" that says the caps will be withdrawn unless california ' s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the regional grid now under ferc control . if davis doesn ' t sign on to the regional grid by june lst , then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines blaming him for letting the "" bush price caps plan "" collapse .  4 . growing fiscal risk in california  sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as $ 20 billion on power this summer - this is more than the combined enterprise value of pg & e and sce . these sources believe that , because of the severity of the situation , the ferc and / or the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power .  the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about 90 days . one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long - term power deals . the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to california .  the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture . the country ' s largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months .  5 . qfs to seek advance payment from pg & e  meanwhile , on the bankruptcy front , the qfs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge ' s accounts , since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas . it appears very unlikely that the qfs ' request will be granted . if the qfs do not receive advance payment , it is likely that most of the 4 , 000 mw of gas - fired qf capacity will remain offline .  6 delays likely in new qf generation  the qf deals made with the state for long - term contracts are being continually renegotiated , which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated .  7 . consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan  harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan . the analysis was done by a utilities analyst , rather than a lawyer , though it appears to raise a number of good legal points . for example , one of the elements of the mou is a "" non - bypassable "" charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid . this is effectively a tax , since there is no exchange of value for money , which under the ca constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity . this makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds , rather than revenue bonds . according to the constitution , the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company . for this and other reasons , even if the republicans would vote for the sce bailout , which remains unlikely , the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge .  8 . governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long - term power contracts  the issue of the governor ' s failure to disclose the details of the long - term power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis . even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating , it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged , creating an even further delay .",0

"Subject: invitations to presentation only  hi christie ,  when do you sleep ? 2 am , ugh !  ok , you were correct , my invitation was to those people within enron that the students talked with before interviewing competitors , and it was an invitation to the presentation only . i didn ' t think any of them would be invited to the dinner , and probably none will even come to the presentation . the invitation did elicit one request for the final report though , so maybe it wasn ' t a complete waste .  i didn ' t realize that the dinner had turned into a box visit . that sounds great . i wish the group could have made it to dinner before the first game , that would have made the whole slumming experience better . now they ' ll get the royal treatment at enron field . it ' ll be great .  vince invited 4 people from rice :  dennis w . loughridge , director of energy consortium ; lounghrid @ rice . edu  carrie miller , director of mba program ; cmiller @ rice . edu  deborah barrett , inst . communications , barrett @ rice . edu  dr . wil uecker , associate dean for executive education , uecker @ rice . edu  loughridge wrote back saying he ' ll come , i don ' t know about the others  here are the 6 students emails :  "" ritwik \ ( ronnie \ ) ghosh "" , "" ivy ghose "" , "" luigi calabrese "" , "" pravas sud "" , "" syed \ ( farhan \ ) iqbal ""  your 2 from rice makes a total of 12 from rice , i guess  let me know if you would like me to do anything else related to monday  look forward to seeing you then  ken",0

"Subject: auctions with an incumbent ' s right of first refusal  shelley ,  my colleague , clayton vernon , who has a background in economics , wrote a  short summary of arguments  against the rofr .  we are working on the second approach to the problem : we try to come up with  a numerical estimate of the  value of this option . the fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has  distributional consequences :  he has something of value he never paid for . having a numerical estimate of  the value of this option  could help to argue against it . the value of such an option is case specific ;  so we shall rather  produce a template you can use for valuation case by case .  vince kaminski  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by vince j kaminski / hou / ect on 01 / 20 / 2000  08 : 34 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  clayton vernon @ enron  01 / 20 / 2000 08 : 29 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc : stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , zlu / hou / ect @ ect  subject : auctions with an incumbent ' s right of first refusal  vince -  here is an essay on the issue you are discussing :  the adverse economic impact of "" rights of first refusal ""  an option to "" first refuse "" to match a competitor ' s offer is a restraint of  free trade and an impediment to efficiency in the marketplace . this economic  conclusion is unambiguous .  if an "" incumbent "" has the right to match an offer made by a competitor , for  an item or service of value , then few competitors will invest the time and  expense necessary to prepare and submit offers , those offers will be lower  than they would have been otherwise , and the contract will often be awarded  to an inefficient incumbent instead of a more efficient challenger .  in a traditional auction , where all bids are sealed and the item up for  auction is awarded to the highest bidder , we can safely predict the item will  be awarded to the bidder who values it the most , at a price reflecting the  full value of the item up for auction . this is the efficient result in a  market economy , because the financing of the high bid reflects resources  freely allocated to the high bidder . if the auction has open bids , we can  again safely predict the item to be awarded to the correct bidder , albeit at  a slightly lower price to the donor of the item since the bidder with the  highest valuation can simply increment by an infinitesimal amount the  second - highest valuation .  now , in a modified auction , where an incumbent bidder has the right to match  the highest bid and retain the item for himself , each competing bidder must  justify his own due diligence and bid preparation expenses against the  following , and likely , scenario : the incumbent does not spend himself for due  diligence , but instead uses these savings to help finance his matching the  top bid from a competitor .  simply put , the incumbent with a "" right of first refusal "" can be safely  predicted to simply match their competitor ' s bid by "" rule of thumb . "" but the  incumbent ' s valuation of the item up for auction can be less than the  valuation of the competitor , by the amount of the due diligence and  administrative expenses . and , the incumbent firm expropriates the expertise  of his competitors , not only in their valuations themselves , a nontrivial  financial exercise , but in any operational details required to be submitted  along with the bid .  furthermore , in an esoteric concept known as the "" winner ' s curse , "" a bidder  realizes that if his bid actually prevails , if the incumbent fails to match  it , he almost certainly overbid .  given this , most competitors will not even bother to bid in an auction when  an incumbent has the right of first refusal , and those that submit a bid do  not rationally invest the time , expense and expertise necessary ; they may  just "" fire off "" a "" low - ball "" bid . after all , in almost every conceivable  "" state of the world "" arising from the auction the competitors expect to lose  money . so , the incumbent almost always retains the contract at a  below - market price , despite the incumbent not necessarily placing the highest  value on the contract because the incumbent cannot put the contract to its  most efficient use .",0

"" while bansal declined comment on the board  decision , the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to  holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were  possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the  state . ( pti )  the economic times , friday apr 27 2001  mseb pays rs 134 cr under ' protest ' to dpc  despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head ,  maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of  rs 134 crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to  dabhol . "" we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself , but dpc  officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh "" , a senior  mseb official said . "" we have disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore and it would  be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india  managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members "" , mseb sources  said .  last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that  it would not accept "" protest payments "" anymore . cline had said the energy  major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in  fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the  "" purported protest or reservation "" . mseb had paid a rs 113 . 5 crore february  bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international  lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the  multinational ' s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state  government . ( pti )  business standard , friday , april 27 , 001  enron india md authorised to terminate ppa  the board of the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) , at its meeting in  london on wednesday , authorised the managing director of enron india to issue  a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra  state electricity board and the state government .  & the board has authorised  wade cline to serve the termination notice . however , this does not mean that  the termination notice will be served immediately . it is only an enabling  provision and will be used only if the situation arises ,  8 a state government  source told business standard from london . he said dpc was under pressure  from its lenders .  the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue . the hardening of  the board  , s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc ' s lenders , who  had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice .  the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not  be served at this stage . serving of the notice requires a nod from the  lenders , who have an exposure of about $ 2 billion in the project . sources  said given the lenders ' strong opposition to termination of the contract , the  enron board ' s "" enabling resolution "" did not have much significance beyond  conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio . the  maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of  crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice . the state government is to  nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract .  enron holds 65 per cent in dpc , while us - based ge and bechtel hold 10 per  cent each . the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose  vehicle , maharashtra power development corporation . the mseb representatives  were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party .  the idbi representative protested against the board ' s decision . the meeting  was attended by state energy secretary vm lal . the meeting was held against  the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills .  after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill , dpc  invoked the state government ' s guarantee and then the union government ' s  counter guarantee . when payment of the rs 127 - crore january bill became  overdue , dpc again invoked the state government ' s guarantee . mseb retaliated  on january 28 , 2001 by slapping a rs 401 - crore penalty for non - supply of  electricity at adequate levels . it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against  this penalty . "" this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting "" ,  a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb ' s stand and  refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the  political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration  between the centre and dpc is currently on .  the financial express , friday , april 27 , 2001  foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog & raghu mohan  global banks comfortable with enron pull - out  lenders to the dabhol power company ( dpc ) are a sharply divided lot .  international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones  led by the the industrial develoment bank of india ( idbi ) , are categorical  that additional assistance to dpc  , s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite  the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a  preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state  electricity board ( mseb ) within the next four weeks . this follows the  authorisation given to enron india  , s managing director k wade cline and dpc  president & ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer  notices to mseb , following wednesday  , s dpc board meeting in london .  the essence of the message from the international lenders following the  london meeting with dpc board is : emotions do not work . contractual  obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has  failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with  the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc  , s  debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders  are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is .  however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a  messy affair .  sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to  phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect  their interests more given that they have no security  * other than assets  *  like a sovereign cover .  & it was this desperation that made local lenders like  idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5  per cent ,  8 a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made  clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were : a )  there are contractual obligations b ) mseb was not punctual in its payments to  dpc and c ) mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore  rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of  power .  while local lenders led by idbi  * with mseb parroting the same  * were of the  view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders  were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is  despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination  given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers  pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and  protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped  in its present form . the points of contention are : a ) that phase - i of dpc is  backed by a sovereign guarantee b ) phase - ii is not and c ) to the extent that  phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets  *  even those under phase - i  * getting attached . therefore , an examination on the  segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted .  pti adds : in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to  sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial  liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc  president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of  power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday .  the indian express , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron : dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb  the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp ,  has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) that it  intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held  in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo  neil mcgregor and enron india  , s managing director k wade cline to serve a   +  + preliminary  ,  , termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the  next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb  began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power $ 48 million for  power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after  mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply  power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid $ 24  million for february . and a payment of $ 31 million was made for march on  thursday .  the $ 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india  to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to  suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary  termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to  the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision  as a  +  + procedural  ,  , move consistent with dpc  , s negotiating strategy to  recover overdue payments from the mseb .  after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would  be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the  company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated ,  the government of india will have to take a hit of $ 300 million besides  paying bills of rs 1 , 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty .   +  + our ( centre  , s ) liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be  one year  , s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million ,  ,  , power  secretary a k basu said .  +  + contractually , the centre will have to pay one year  ,  s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , 400 - 1 , 500 crore ,  and take over dpc  , s debt , which stands at around $ 300 million , if the project  was terminated ,  ,  , basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of  completing the second phase of the 2 , 184 - megawatt power - plant project , which  is 95 per cent through .  while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company  to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the  company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the  meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had  strongly opposed dpc  , s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices  for termination .  mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar  * both  directors on the dpc board  * and the state principal secretary ( energy ) vm  lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in  london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly  +  + threatening  ,  , to issue various  arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in  isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the  mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra  * a step  typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war ,  coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc  , s move was  viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire  because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the  company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around  rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers .  the hindu , friday , april 27 , 2001  offer of renegotiation ' too late ' : enron , by mahesh vijapurkar  mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night  authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power  purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board , has  decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that  the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in  reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa .  as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , ` ` it is not sudden death  of the project ' ' and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the  developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole  committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . ` ` this would  only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot  of legal work is involved ' ' . apparently , the dpc intends to do some  arm - twisting .  at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially  disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions  on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the  offer of renegotiation had come rather ` ` too late ' ' . it also said it did not  see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out  the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to  authorise termination was a new weapon .  the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc  would not take any ` ` harsh step ' ' which would cause lot of damage to the  interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today  he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the  strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation  was the requirement and not confrontation .  echo in ls  the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister ,  mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre  rs . 2 , 840 crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the  centre ' s liability in case of termination is one year ' s electricity bill and  a termination fee of $ 300 million .  blow to fis  the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial  institutions ( fis ) which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to  convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of  indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee  either of the centre or the state .  the times of india , friday , 27 april 2001  enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait  the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised  the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state  electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet ,  considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured  renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though  foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial  institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over  the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders '  consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project .  the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice  was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a  move .  another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the  financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the  project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms .  institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package ,  which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . ` ` the board  has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the  meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the  project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , ' ' said mseb  chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . ` ` mseb presented their  views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included  the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings .  ` ` we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high  and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable , "" bansal added .  ` ` they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our  exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any  plans in that direction , ' ' said a top banker who was present during the  lenders ' meet . ` ` there is a general consensus that the project must be  completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , ' '  he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank ,  credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india ,  where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company  officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination  notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project  favours such proceedings .  meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa .  ` ` we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that  would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , ' ' deshmukh said . deshmukh was  echoing union power minister suresh prabhu ' s sentiments , who said that the  government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however ,  added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and  dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $ 2 . 9 billion project would  be a blow to india ' s efforts to woo foreign investors .  the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three  arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues  amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december  2000 and january 2001 . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the  march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest  payment , despite the dispute over the amount .  when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc .  the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , 2001  dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice  the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) has authorised the  managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to  terminate its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state  electricity board ( mseb ) ` ` at an appropriate time ' ' . the decision was taken  at a board meeting held in london yesterday . ` ` while mseb , which is an  ` interested party ' , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation  clarifying its stand on the matter , ' ' a senior state government official  said .  the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice  was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the  official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to  a six - month ` ` suspension period ' ' . according to clause 17 . 8 of the  termination procedure , of the ppa : ` ` following the giving of a preliminary  termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months ( or  such longer period as they may agree ) as to what step shall be taken with a  view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to  all the circumstances . . . ' '  idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier  persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination  notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company  to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in  favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however ,  domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa  is abandoned mid - way .  according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the  parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and  central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao  deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the  state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance  minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . ` ` the dpc will now  have to decide what is the ` appropriate time ' to serve the notice , ' ' the  official said . mseb pays rs 134 crore : meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs 134  crore towards its march 2001 bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was  paid ` in protest ' ' today morning . ` ` they ( dpc ) had billed us for an amount of  rs 146 crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , ' ' a senior  mseb official said .  the pioneer , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron testing maharashtra ' s nerves , t n raghunatha  dabhol power company ( dpc ) has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra  state electricity board ( mseb ) , the maharashtra state government and the  centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the  dpc board of directors ' decision to authorise its managing director to serve  a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication .  the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company  management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could  inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , 840 crore on the centre . the decision  to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was  taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government  representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of "" interested  party "" .  when contacted , the company ' s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal ,  declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board .  "" we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london . we will express  our views after a few days , "" he said . however , maharashtra chief minister  vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board ' s decision as  "" unfortunate "" . "" we have already requested the company not to take any harsh  decision "" , mr deshmukh said in mumbai .  official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board ' s  decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the  mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its  tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can  formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state  government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state  electricity board . the sources said that the dpc ' s reported decision to  authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did  not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping  of the power contract with the mseb .  "" if anything , the dpc ' s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on  the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger  position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm  itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its  control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb ,  the centre and the state government , "" the sources said . not surprisingly , the  dpc ' s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government ' s  decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the  mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron ' s  subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state  electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination  notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of  the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dpc .  riday , april 27  the telegraph , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron signal to switch off dabhol power  enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol  power company when it won an authorisation from the company  , s board to stop  sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) .  the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65  per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m  lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders  discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre  , s liability ,  if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year  , s power bill and a  termination fee of $ 300 million . however , the company will have to wait for  six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the  centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on  foreign investment in power if enron walks out .  & we do not see fdi inflows  into the power sector being hit ,  8 power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb  officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate  policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the  decision coincided with a rs 134 - crore  + protest payment  , by the cash - strapped  power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 . 64 crore .  there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers  at enron  , s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of  events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb  officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on  wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide  bandh .  & we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up  at the dispute - resolution forum ,  8 a board official said . last week , dpc told  the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a  move to fortify its legal position .  mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold  around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in  terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game  because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions  are not covered under the centre  , s and state  , s counter - guarantees , unlike  those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh called enron  , s decision unfortunate .  & we had told state government  officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding  up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties .  8  the statesman , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron threatens to pull out  the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power  company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to  serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $ 2 . 9  billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of  dabhol  , s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday  in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state  electricity board , mr vinay bansal .  while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was  itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before  the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress  party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu ,  who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao  deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday .  the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre  is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its  counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political  force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of  exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr  suresh prabhu , contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 . 7 per  cent of the total energy output of the country , its termination would not  have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation .  however , if terminations proceedings go through , enron corp , a 65 per cent  share - holder in the dabhol power company , would stand to net a hefty amount  in damages . the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that  termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 , 800 crore , which is the  total of one years  , electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million .  according to an energy analyst , mr pradyumna kaul , the total liability would  not cross rs 350 crore . however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that  the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 , 840 crore . it  is learnt that on 20 april , mr deshmukh had given the go - ahead to the mseb to  prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc  , s  board of directors on wednesday . at the meeting , the energy minister ,  padamsinh patil , energy secretary , mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr  vinay bansal , were also present . the notice was prepared over the past weekend  and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april .  however , the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough , given  its huge stake in the project , and that such a notice would not be necessary .  the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff ,  with enron  , s consent .  among those present at the london meeting were mr lal , mr bansal and mseb  technical director , mr p paunikar , in their capacity as directors . however ,  they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party . the  only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also  represented on the board , it is learnt . the chief minister , mr vilasrao  deshmukh , said the state was not in favour of terminating the project . this  could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm - twist the indian authorities  could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over  the past three months cleared . the mseb owes enron rs 146 . 64 crore for march  2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001 . the centre today put  up a brave face on enron  , s decision saying there would not be any adverse  effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country , pti reported  from new delhi .   & there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or  foreign company . as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact  on fdi in power sector ,  8 power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when  asked about dpc  , s decision to authorise management to issue a termination  notice to mseb . emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision ,  prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs   & we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as  european nations in the power sector .  & in fact not only the power minister but  also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power  and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector .  8  mid day  ' dpc may not wind up '  maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor ,  managing director of the dabhol power corporation ( dpc ) , has been given  complete powers with regard to dpc ' s operations in the state , including the  authority to wind up operations , it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor  will issue such a termination notice . mcgregor was given the powers at a  meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday . ranganathan said that state  officials , including maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) chairman  vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal , have reported back to him about the  meeting in london .  with regard to the state ' s failure to pay enron , ranganathan said , "" bills  are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) and dpc owes some  money to us . our people informed enron officials about this . . in fact , there  was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice . "" in the  london meeting , mseb and industrial development bank of india ( idbi )  representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could  not supply power whenever needed .  chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the  decision of the board of the enron - promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to  wind up operations . deshmukh added , "" we have already requested enron not to  take any harsh decision . "" deshmukh had earlier said , "" we have directed state  government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy  company from winding up operations in the state , as it would be harmful to  both of us . ""  enron officials are keeping mum on the issue . mcgregor said , "" i am not going  to give any comment . ""  mid day , april 27 , 2001  enron offers ' no comment ' on renegotiation , h s rao  a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company  ( dpc ) , promoted by the us energy major enron , was held here yesterday  apparently to discuss fate of its $ 900 - million power project in maharashtra ,  but there was no official word on the indian and state governments ' decision  to renegotiate the contract .  an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting , saying  the issues discussed at the meeting were ' confidential ' . "" we have not  received any direct communication . unless we get it and evaluate the details ,  we have no comments to make , "" the spokesman said when asked about the  proposed decision on re - negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra  state electricity board ( mseb ) has 15 per cent stake .  asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing  director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india , the spokesman said  he had nothing to say on them . enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to  look at various options including selling the company ' s stake in dpc .  maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state  government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company . he said the  maharashtra government "" is not in favour of terminating the 2184 - mw project ,  but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio . ""  mid day , friday , april 27 , 2001 ,  committee to renegotiate enron deal  a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power  company will be appointed by this evening , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh  said today . addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social  reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha , deshmukh said the  committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow , at the most . he  termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil  mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state  electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with  power company .  "" renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole  committee and the center will also depute its representative on the  renegotiating committee . we don ' t want to take any hasty decision , "" deshmukh  saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its  expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably . when  pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite  state  9 s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee , chief minister  said it was unfortunate .  earlier , in his meeting with hazare , deshmukh promised to make necessary  amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so  that the information was easily accessed by the common people . he also gave a  patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state  departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry  within three months .  afternoon , april 27 , 2001  ' enron ' s on ! '  state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz  the us power giant , enron power corporation ' s willingness to wrap up the  dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise ,  though the dabhol power company chief , mr . wade cline , has been authorised to  do so , since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the  matter .  disclosing this , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that  the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power  project at dabhol could be continued , and at the same time enron did not feel  slighted . "" enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision . we are  waiting for their letter , "" he said . when asked what sort of compromise the  state government plans to forge , mr . deshmukh said , "" let our officers come  back . after that we will decide a future course of action . but we are  definitely going in for renegotiation of the project . it is very difficult to  predict the outcome of enron ' s decision but as of now the project is still  on . "" when asked whether the project could be moved to another state , if wound  up from maharashtra , mr . deshmukh said , that was not possible as per the  terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government .  however , it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself , he  indicated . he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses  if the project was terminated .  the board of directors of the dabhol power company , which met in london on  wednesday , decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project  once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project , if he  deemed it fit . however , this decision , as of now , does not necessarily  indicate the death knell for the project . the enron project , which had been  riddled with controversies right from its inception , had been a pretext for  the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to  time . the previous sena - bjp government , which had been out to terminate the  project , however , chose to continue with it following renegotiations with  enron ' s top visiting officials like ms . rebecca mark . and , the democratic  front government inherited the controversial project when the governments  changed hands a year and a half ago .  meanwhile , state energy minister dr . padamsinh patil , when contacted at the  osmanabad circuit house , said the state government and the central government  have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with  enron . "" it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that .  they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both  sides , "" he said . in case the project is terminated , the government can still  manage the power needs of the state , though it would be a bit tough job , he  added .",0

"Subject: re : got ink ? 21846  what have you been up to ?  i don ' t know about you , but i am sick and tired of going  down to the store to find out that your printer cartridges  cost more than the printer itself ! i know how you feel  - i print over 500 pages a day , and it feels like there is  a vacuum sucking money out of my wallet ! now , this has got  to stop because i know it doesn ' t cost the printer companies  anywhere near what it costs me to do my office and school work !  well , it finally has . the superink solution .  you ' re probably thinking to yourself , "" gosh darn , not another  cheap knockoff printer cartridge ! "" like you , i was very  skeptical at first , but my best friend & business associate  said it helped her save over $ 100 a month on printer supplies .  so i tried it . i mean , there was nothing to lose because they  offer a 100 % satisfaction guarantee , up to a one - year warranty  on all of their products and free shipping on all orders !  let me tell you , it was one of the best decisions i ' ve ever made .  period . six months later , as i ' m writing this message to you ,  i ' ve gone from spending $ 1000 dollars a month on printer supplies  to now only $ 475 ! and i haven ' t had to sacrifice the quality or  service that i received from the local office supply store . in fact ,  the service is even better ! i ' ve had 1 defective cartridge since  i started dealing with superink and they sent me a new replacement  within 3 days , no questions asked . now , i can print all i want !  i was so happy with the results that i contacted their manufacturer  and got permission to be a reseller - at a big discount . i want  to help other people to avoid getting jipped by the printer companies  like i did . because a penny saved is a penny earned !  i give you my personal pledge the superink soltuion will absolutely  work for you . if it doesn ' t , you can return your order anytime  for a full refund .  if you are frustrated with dishing out money like it is water to the  printer companies , or tired of poor quality ink & toner cartridges ,  then i recommend - the superink solution .  you ' re probably asking yourself , "" ok , so how do we save all this money  without losing quality and service ? ""  modern technology has provided superink with unique , revolutionary  methods of wax molding that allow the ink & toner to ' settle ' , which  prevents any substantial damage that would occur during shipping and  handling . nothing "" magic "" about it - just quality & savings , big savings !  here is the bottom line . . .  i can help you save 30 % - 70 % per week / per month / per year or per lifetime  by purchasing any of our ink & toner supplies . just try it once , you ' ll  keep coming back - there ' s nothing to lose , and much money to be saved !  100 % satisfaction guaranteed . you will be able to print as much as you  want without wasting money or sacrificing quality - guaranteed .  that is my pledge to you .  to order from the superink solution on our secure server , just click  on the link below ( or enter it into your browser ) :  http : / / www . superink . net /  if you have difficulty accessing the website above , please  try contacting us toll - free at 1 - 800 - 758 - 8084 - thanks !  sincerely - bruce tipton  if you do not wish to receive any more emails from me , please  send an email to "" print 2 @ btamail . net . cn "" requesting to be removed .  thank you and sorry for any inconvenience .

"Subject: corrected : new update on ppi model for inflation book  dear all ,  i followed up on the suggestions at the conference call as follows : -  1 ) use less data  unfortunately , kicking out only 1990 makes the overall equation a lot less  robust , in fact dramatically so , and so eliminates the possibility of using  less data . the model tested was the rpi ( month + 15 ) ppi pre - empts the moves in rpi by about 8 months . the  magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced . this shows that if we had  more detail in our rpi forward curve , then the ppi model would reflect those  peaks and humps adequately .  conclusion  i therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates rpi , rpi [ t + 15 ]  and deviations of brent crude from long - term average . the new model is  plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old ppi which is  depicted in blue .  the new model achieves the two main objectives of the ppi curve : it is  significantly more robust and stable than the existing one , and it is  considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients , which results in us  having more confidence in our monthly p it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from the  long - term average of $ 18 . 80 was the best form of the variable to use ( for  predictions the brent forward curve produced by the global products group is  used ) . the three new equations developed were : -  pllu ( t ) = a . rpi ( t ) + b . rpi ( t + n ) + c . ( datedbrentcrude - 18 . 8 ) + constant ,  where n is 14 , 15 or 16  [ reddish curves ]  r - squared approx 0 . 49  f - stat approx 32  the chart below shows what our projected pllu curve would be given this  equation , and also the three best relations from before which were based upon  current and future rpi :  pllu ( t ) = a . rpi ( t ) + b . rpi ( t + n ) + constant , where n is 14 , 15 or 16  [ greenish curves ]  r - squared approx 0 . 47  f - stat approx 45  comparison of models  as you can see , the two equations differ in the very short - term and very  long - term ; the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to short - term  predictions of 3 . 0 % to 3 . 2 % over the next six months . the greenish curves  predict pllu in the range of 2 . 5 % to 2 . 8 % over the next six months .  the curves are then very similar until 2009 , when the models including crude  break - away to the upside , relative to the falling rpi curve . the model based  purely on rpi hugs the rpi curve much more closely in the longer term . this  is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009  ( which we don ' t ) .  suggestion  what could be useful now is a differently - specified model designed to  forecast only the next 3 months , using auto - regressive or auto - regressive  error terms . this model would be far more accurate in the near - term , and we  could include this information onto the front of this long - term model . this  may be useful , despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time  buckets .  back - testing  all the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data  sample used ( based mainly on 1990 s "" new paradigm "" economy ) .  hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele - conference ;  your ideas on this would be appreciated .  regards ,  anjam  x 35383",0

"Subject: re : real options presentation  thanks for the comments grant . the presentation is for a couple of external  conferences that vince volunteered me for - vince has ok ' d the content , and  stinson raised exactly the same issues as you . unfortunately i just don ' t  seem to be getting any response from risk whatsoever on the publication of my  article , so these conferences will be the public debut for my real options  notation .  of course the discounting / risk neutrality thing is where the real judgement  sits . when questions arise i ' ll take the line that while research formulates  the models using appropriate derivatives / market based valuation methods , we  work with our rac group which considers the discounting to be associated with  various risks , and chooses these rates appropriately . the notation makes  clear which uncertainties we are exposed to at different stages of the deals ,  which assists in choosing the rates .  in practice i ' m not yet at the stage where originators are using my notation  yet - another reason i can ' t say too much about its actual use at the  conference . i ' m producing various tools for deterministic hydro  optimization , gbm swing option valuation , and deterministic dp optimization  for genset dispatch which people want right now - i ' m working in the  background on the kind of modelling my notation demands . people are getting  to know me as a guy who can solve their immediate problems , and they ' ll be  more likely to listen when i start rolling out the "" proper "" options - based  models . my notation is currently used only in the specs i ' m writing for the  tools i ' m producing .  i ' ll be turning dale ' s spreadsheet - based power plant spread model into an  american monte carlo tool , which will then be available for inclusion in  other models . i think by the end of the summer the real options theoretical  work will start to bear fruit , one year after i initially proposed the  notation . with the quant it group i ' m co - creating in place , i may yet see  the automated diagramming / pricing tool made real .  thanks also for the pointer to tom halliburton . the use of the lingo  lp / integer package is something i ' ve been presented with for the teesside  plant operation optimizer , rather than something i chose . the perm ( physical  energy risk mgt ) group just got a couple of analysts to hack it together  ( including natasha danilochkina ) , then asked me to tidy it up when it didn ' t  work . they are going to use their existing faulty model for now ( to meet  their project deadlines ) , and i ' m sketching out a proper mathematical spec  for the problem .  i ' ve persuaded ( ! ) them that this sort of business - critical system should be  developed properly by research , and they now seem happy to fall into line .  their wilton plant optimizer was developed by one peter morawitz , the guy i  hoped to recruit into research , and they obviously didn ' t realise he was  better than average at quantitative modelling . anyway they now accept that  doing it properly will take months rather than weeks , and i ' ll have a freer  hand in my choice of modelling tool - so a chat with tom would be extremely  valuable .  cheers ,  steve  enron capital is  this an internal enron or external presentation ? if external , i would say it  is just at the limit before sliding into proprietary stuff . perhaps that ' s  why you ' ve neatly almost entirely avoided questions about discounting and  risk - neutrality or lack of it ?  regards ,  grant .",0

"Subject: sddp model  john ,  attached is a copy of the sddp methodology manual , written by the  developers . the model was developed by mario pereira , who is the proprietor  of psri ( power systems research inc ) in rio de janeiro . their web site is :  www . psr - inc . com where you can find more information about the company and  contact details . mario and most of the staff speak english , so phone calls  are possible .  development of sddp was originally done on a world bank contract to compare  the benefits of new generation and transmission system interconnections in  central america . it has since found much wider application . the code runs  on a pc , and is licensed to a number of consultants , power companies , etc .  while i was with ecnz in wellington , new zealand , we purchased a copy around  1994 .  the model works with weekly or monthly time steps , with a time horizon of  from 1 to 10 years , for mid to long range planning of hydro thermal power  systems . it represents loads in each period as from one to five load blocks ,  so it is not a chronological model . this type of model can not handle  thermal plant ramp rates and similar chronological system constraints . i ' m  not sure how important that would be to you . the optimization phase of the  model takes into account hydrological uncertainty using a form of stochastic  dynamic programming with sampling . this phase sets up a function for water  value in each large reservoir in the system . the simulation phase uses a  number of hydrological outcomes to collect statistics on how the system would  operate . the water values can be used with the short term optimization mode  of sddp or in some other more detailed short term optimization model .  most constraints found in hydro systems can be modelled . many transmission  constraints can be modelled . a dc load flow option can be used to determine  bus nodal prices .  a visual basic user interface is provided which reads and writes text files .  if you ' d like to know more about sddp , you could call me here in houston .

"Subject: california update 3 / 15 / 01  executive summary  ? davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for  past utility debt  ? davis and pg & e negotiations at a standstill , sticking point is net short  for pg & e this summer  ? as the days go on with no word of a secured deal , involuntary bankruptcy  chances increase significantly among small generators and qfs  ? ferc would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions  for california  california public utility commission rate increases  today may be the turning point as the ca puc reviews the size of the  department of water resources ( dwr ) rate increase to be passed along to  consumers on their electricity bills . until now , davis has considered rate  hikes to be political suicide , but there may be some relief for him from  consumer groups . sources indicate that one of california ' s main consumer  advocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption ,  but remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt . dwr ,  which is currently buying power on behalf of the state , needs more income to  securitize the planned $ 10 b bond issue that is key part of davis ' plan to  sign long term power contracts . as dwr continues to spend $ 40 to $ 60 m every  day on power purchases , a well placed source informed us the dwr is  essentially bankrupt . it currently has no money for normal activities such  as ordering supplies , purchasing new equipment , etc . the department of  finance is forwarding dwr money from where ever it can ( parks , other  programs ) to purchase power , but dwr ' s hands are tied until revenue bonds are  issued . the california state treasurer phil angelides will be submitting a  recommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover $ 10  billion worth of state bonds .  davis & pg & e at odds  sources report that davis and pg & e negotiations are facing two difficult  challenges : 1 ) pg & e wants 2 . 9 times book , which is far more than consumer  groups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines ( sce accepted 2 . 3 ) ,  and 2 ) pg & e needs relief from davis for pg & es legal responsibility to be the  ultimate power purchaser for the state , and at this point davis wants to  limit further state energy power purchases ( especially for summer ) . the  utilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars  further in the red ( $ 3 to $ 4 b ) and pg a measure that if accomplished would  provide davis with even less negotiating power .  with all this activity , davis is starting to lose support in the state  legislature . sources report increasing tension between the governor and  state senate president pro - tem john burton . burton has just announced a  special senate committee will investigate the generators for evidence of  price manipulation , and the state auditor is also planning an investigation .  davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being  picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later .  qf ' s most likely source of involuntary bankruptcy  sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience  and force bankruptcy on the utilities . sb 47 x may have been california ' s  qualified facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing  against pg & e , socal ed , and sdg & e . the bill designed to cut the qf ' s costs  and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the state ' s  senate . sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further  investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates .  out with hebert , in with wood  the bush administration favors replacing hebert , jr . with texas puc head pat  wood . there is an intense battle behind the scenes between senate republican  leader trent lott , who favors hebert , and president bush , who wants wood .  the administration would prefer wood because they do not want ferc to pick a  fight with davis which means bush might ultimately lose some western states  in 2004 . in effort to tone down the recent press reports , hebert has made  several token concessions to california , including $ 69 million worth of power  refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and  power plant installation .  it ' s is expected that ferc would most likely approve any transmission deal  that davis could complete but with a list of conditions . some conditions  might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well  as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic administrative actions in  the west next year . the bush administration is opposed to price caps and  believes in free market solutions . the administration is also considering  whether it might be a good idea to privatize federally - owned assets such as  bpa .",0

supply estimates and several legal requirements and permissions .  in fact , the committee has found that the mseb has been paying enron rs 930 crore more than it should every year . this comprises overcharging of rs 253 crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only 42 per cent of the capacity is used for dpc . there ' s also a rs 100 crore extra billing to the mseb for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of these facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge . by charging more than twice the operations & maintenance rate stipulated by the government of india , enron collects approximately rs 246 crore extra every year . it has also been collecting rs 332 crore every year through inflated fuel consumption claims . enron has been charging at 1878 kcal / kwh under the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed it a much lower consumption rate . this gives it a fat fuel arbitrage opportunity at the cost of the people of maharashtra .  the committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four different exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation : a rate of rs 32 per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee loans , rs 34 . 5 per dollar as reference rate for phase - i , rs 39 . 35 per dollar as reference rate for phase - ii and a curious rs 42 per dollar for calculating government of india tariff . forcing a reduction of these excessive charges has nothing to do with contract cancellation . all it needs is tough negotiation and public pressure on the political establishment .  the godbole committee has established that dpc ' s tariffs can easily be halved if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the dollarisation of payments , the take - or - pay clause and escrow facility ( which is in fact hampering mseb ' s reform particularly in power distribution ) are scrapped . the security of future payments to dpc under the restructured tariff would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system . the committee also gives enron a difficult escape route . it says that if the multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous , it should free mseb from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside maharashtra . the committee has tried to establish another precedent on all projects negotiated by government : "" the public has a right to know what is being contracted on their behalf "" and has recommended that all documents , including contracts related to all independent power projects ( ipps ) , particularly dpc , should be published by the maharashtra government within two months .  also , having established that demand - supply estimates by the state government were fanciful , the committee has asked mseb to defer all negotiations with power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption of power generation from such ipps . it recommends that such negotiations should be in accordance with the least - cost plan spelt out by the report . this should also end the hectic lobbying by reliance ( patalganga ) , mittals ( bhadravati ) , the bses ( saphale ) and others to set up ipps in maharashtra .  - - -

in - fact "" and authorise him to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contracts and financing agreements and their amendments and modifications . top sources told the financial express that dpc would authorise mr cline and / or mr mcgregor to serve the preliminary termination notices and transfer notices to the state and central governments and mseb under clause 17 and schedule 11 of the ppa .  "" in response to the continuing default by the mseb of its payment obligations under the ppa , the failure of the government of maharashtra to honour obligations under its guarantee and state support agreement and failure of the government of india to honour obligations under its counter guarantee , the company has sought recourse to dispute resolution and has initiated conciliation and arbitration proceedings , "" the company resolution said . "" consistent with this recourse to contractual remedies , the company now seeks the authority to serve preliminary termination notices and transfer notices pursuant to clause 17 and schedule 11 of the ppa from time to time and at any time upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to its right to serve such notices as determined by the company , "" the resolution added .  according to the resolution , the directors , the company secretary and officers of the company and each of them acting individually , are authorised and empowered to execute and deliver such documents and instruments and take such other actions as they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution , in the name and for and on behalf of the company . against this backdrop , the state government and mseb have been exploring the possibilities of issuing termination notice to the dpc for its failure to meet the contractual obligations under the ppa . the state government and mseb sources said that such a notice could be served by the mseb as dpc has not paid the rebate ( penalty ) of rs 409 crore for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power on january 28 and february 13 .  the state government and mseb , which reviewed its position on saturday at a meeting convened by the chief minister vilasrao deshmukh , are of the view that they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the termination notice to the dpc . the dpc ' s move to appoint mr k wade cline as its "" true and lawful attorney - in - fact "" deserves importance especially when the state government proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit cost and gauge the possibility of sale of dabhol power to the power deficit states .  mr cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out or obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in the ordinary course in amounts exceeding rs 64 crore or the equivalent in foreign currency in any financial year . furthermore , mr cline would be in a position to enter into contracts and take any other actions for purpose relating to the day - to - day operation of the company ' s business or exercise its rights and discharge its obligations under the project contracts and the financing agreements  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - business standard , monday , april 23 , 2001  dpc seeks ok to exit power project , tamal bandyopadhyay otherwise it cannot be a complete exercise , "" he added .  deshmukh and the mseb team are scheduled to meet union finance minister yashwant sinha and power minister suresh prabhu on monday in new delhi to discuss the stalemate and find a acceptable solution for the same . "" i am meeting sinha and prabhu to request them to take an initiative and send representatives for the negotiations committee , "" he said . deshmukh ' s meeting with the centre comes at a crucial stage as dpc ' s lenders would be meeting in london , on the same day , to decide upon the future finances of the controversy marred 2 , 184 - mw project in dabhol .  moreover , the dpc board is also scheduled to meet on april 25 in london to decide the fate of its $ 900 million project in dabhol , including winding up of its operations . the meeting would discuss the topmost item on the agenda , which was to empower dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up operations in the country . dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore plus interest towards the bills due for the months of december 2000 and january 2001 .  asked whether the centre had send any feel over a possible clubbing together of the arbitration and conciliation processes , deshmukh replied in the negative . deshmukh said mseb chairman vinay bansal along with two senior officials would attend dpc ' s board meeting in london . bansal had said on sunday that mseb would present its case concerning the rs 401 - crore penalty that the loss - making board slapped on dpc on february 28 , for not generating required power within the stipulated time as per the ppa . currently , enron india holds 65 per cent in the $ 900 - million dpc project , which includes mseb ' s 15 per cent , while general electric and bechtel hold 10 per cent each .

""  - - energy review committee headed by former home secretary madhav godbole  this could well be the real enron story  a five - member high - powered committee headed by madhav godbole - and including former union economic affairs secretary e . a . s . sarma , hdfc chairman deepak parekh , teri chairman rajendrapachauri and maharashtra government official vinay mohan lal - has recommended a judicial probe into the entire enron power project deal saying it signified "" the utter failure of governance that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision - making process relating to the dabhol project "" . the report , which was submitted to the maharashtra government last fortnight and has been acquired by outlook , is severely critical of former chief minister sharad pawar ( with the congress then ) , the 13 - day bjp - led union government which reworked the deal in 1996 , shiv sena supremo balasaheb thackeray and his government in maharashtra headed by manohar joshi  "" the utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every step of decision - making relating to the dabhol project . "" madhav godbole committee report  an investigation , if ordered , could embarrass at least these three governments the report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid by enron to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal . according to the committee , the deal reveals failure of governance , both at the centre and state , and across different agencies . "" it strains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely coincidental , "" the report said , proposing a set of measures to be implemented if something of the project was to be retrieved . godbole and sarma also felt that the panel should categorically recommend the government of india to order a judicial inquiry . this was finally adopted by it . says a congress leader : "" enron could well become the biggest political issue in maharashtra and put to question liberalisation , particularly in the power sector . ""  the proposal has already struck panic . says ncp ' s praful patel : "" if the enron decision has at all been detrimental , it is because of the haste with which phase 2 was cleared by the shiv sena - bjp government . now with the state having already entered into an agreement with enron , the important thing is to resolve it amicably . a judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because it ' s not an issue of corruption but that of perception . ""  pro - market congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the centre and the state which invited enron , even though the second phase was cleared by the bjp - shiv sena combine . says congress spokesperson jaipal reddy : "" right now we ' re too involved with the parliament deadlock over tehelka . "" pro - liberalisation congress mps also fear that such witch - hunting could send wrong signals to foreign investors . non - congress mps from maharashtra , meanwhile , claim that the godbole committee was instituted with the express purpose of politicising the enron issue . "" i think i know vilasrao deshmukh ' s gameplan , "" says an mp from the state . but some mps like congress ' prithviraj chavan question the cloak of secrecy that ' s surrounded the deal : "" i ' ve maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to examine this "" .  the committee report also says that had the enron project been subjected to a techno - economic appraisal , as envisaged under provisions of the electricity supply act of 1948 and related legislations , the infirmities could have been avoided . since this wasn ' t done , questions about a concerted effort towards exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to arise , the exhaustive 93 - page report points out .  "" i ' d highlight the speed with which the 13 - day vajpayee government cleared the project minutes before it quit , "" says congress mp prithviraj chavan .  the enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending liberalisation in the early ' 90 s and , despite several controversies , is now an established power project at dabhol , 150 km south of mumbai . in july 1992 , enron signed an mou with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) to set up a 2 , 550 mw station as part of the government ' s ' fast track ' projects .  subsequently , when the shiv - sena - bjp came to power in maharashtra it filed a writ against the project . this curiously led to renegotiations with enron . the committee has quoted a bombay high court order on the renegotiated deal . "" once it ( gom ) decided to revive the project , it acted in the very same manner its predecessors in office had done . it forgot all about competitive bidding and transparency . the speed with which the negotiating group studied the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons , which was accepted by dabhol , is unprecedented . "" says chavan : "" i would particularly like to highlight the speed with which the 13 - day vajpayee government at centre endorsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned . ""  since the commissioning of the plant in may 1999 , the mseb has paid rs 1 , 607 crore for the power it has bought from dabhol . if the same watttage of power had been bought from indian - built power plants fired by indigenous coal , the payment would have been approximately rs 736 crore . in the first year - and - a - half of its operation itself , the dpc had drained the maharashtra exchequer of nearly rs 1 , 000 crore .  the central electricity authority ( cea ) , in fact , pointed out that the dabhol plant was not the least costly option . the mseb had other inexpensive alternatives like the four units of kaparkheda , but they were in a preliminary stage . the report notes : "" . . . if the mseb had made efforts to seriously pursue these projects , they might not have remained in their preliminary stages "" . it adds that the members were of the opinion that "" the mseb and the maharashtra government erred seriously , based on information available at that time , in proceeding with the dpc as a base - load factor even when its capacity was reduced . "" the failure seems to have been compounded by the laxity of the union power ministry , finance ministry and the cea . it quotes the cea as saying that since the union finance ministry found the tariff reasonable , no further examination was required  strangely , bal thackeray ' s shiv sena , when it came to power together with the bjp in maharashtra , filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the deal .  after the new shiv sena - bjp government took over , its cm , manohar joshi , appointed a renegotiating committee in 1996 which made the right noises , actually managing to reduce the tariff . but certain things remained inexplicable . no fresh clearances were required from the cea , which also said that "" since no cost increase was involved . . . fresh formal clearance wasn ' t necessary . "" says the committee : "" this only adds strength to the suspicion that the cea didn ' t consider the economic aspects of the project at all . indeed , given the non - availability of any official record of the meeting on june 24 , 1994 , with the committee and the nature of this letter dated december 23 , 1994 , the committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects of dpc were discussed at all . ' '  the credibility of the shiv sena - bjp government has been seriously questioned . "" the committee finds it unexplicable ( sic ) why there was no mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from $ 2 , 828 million to $ 2 , 501 million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiating committee , "" the panel observes . says lawyer prashant bhushan : "" it is strange that the shiv sena - bjp government first filed a writ in the court and then coolly renegotiated the deal . "" the committee further spells out the losses incurred through the deal . "" subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc , the financial deterioration of mseb has been rapid . while the mseb was in profit in 1998 - 99 , it plunged into huge losses of rs 1681 crore in 1999 - 2000 . ""  significantly , the world bank in 1993 had predicted the system ' s inherent weaknesses . in a letter written to the then power secretary , r . vasudevan , a top bank official had said that "" after a detailed review of the analytical framework and costing assumptions , we reconfirm our earlier conclusion that the dabhol project , as presently formulated , is not economically justified "" and that in "" our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb system in 1998 . the proposed base - load operation could result in uneconomic plant dispatch , as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be replaced by the higher cost lng power . ""  enron ' s persistence and the ' gullibility ' of the indian side can be gauged from high - ranking enron official joe sutton ' s letter to a key indian official , ajit nimbalkar : "" i recently met with the world bank and have been following the articles in the india papers . i feel that the world bank opinion can be changed . we ' ll engage a pr firm and hopefully manage the media from here on . the project has solid support from all other agencies in washington . ""  the key question in the enron deal is whether a developed state like maharashtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all ? for the first time the godbole committee has raised objections about the viability of such a project . according to the report , the mseb has been one of the better performing boards in the country and has , despite a faulty transmission and distribution ( t and d ) system , managed to consistently earn net revenue surpluses on an accrual basis .  maharashtra accounts for nearly one - fourth of the gross value of india ' s industrial sector . it ' s one of the few states to achieve 100 per cent electrification . since ' 95 , the mseb has been adding to its generation . "" this improvement , which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation undertaken by the mseb , exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dpc was being considered , "" the report points out . following a policy of cross - subsidy , roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised .  but the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn ' t been much . in fact , the subsidy claim decreased from rs 630 crore in 1995 - 96 to rs 355 crore in 1998 - 99 , until in 1999 - 2000 it increased nearly five - fold to rs 2 , 084 crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by 26 paise per unit - from 15 to 41 paise - an increase of 173 per cent . "" the increase in the subsidy claim by rs 1 , 729 crore is due to the increase in the gap principally because of the increase in power purchase costs , "" says the committee , adding : "" without the dpc and without problems of t and d loss , the mseb could be financially healthy . ""  but can that happen now since enron is here to stay ? the committee has come up with some far - reaching recommendations : make public all dabhol - related documents and agreements , restructure the dabhol project itself to bring down the cost of power , restructure dpc financially , allow sale of dpc power outside maharashtra , re - examine ppas in accordance with least - cost plans , and thoroughly reform the mseb . the committee know this can become reality only with political consensus and through forming of public opinion . the question is , can that be achieved in an unstable political environment ?  with priya sahgal  making of a scam  ? 1992 : centre invites enron to set up ' fast track ' power project  ? dec 1993 : first ppa signed with mseb  ? 1994 : enron starts construction  ? 1995 : sena - bjp govt scraps enron  ? 1996 : state govt renegotiates project  ? 1996 : 13 - day vajpayee govt approves counter - guarantee  ? may 1996 : state cabinet clears ppa  ? may 13 , 1999 : phase i commissioned  ? jul 1999 : financial closure for phase ii  ? oct 2000 : mseb defaults on payment , subsequently stops paying monthly bills  ? feb 6 , 2001 : enron invokes central government ' s counter - guarantee  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - business standard , monday , april 23 , 2001  mseb revenue collections up at rs 968 crore in march , renni abraham  the maharashtra state electricity board ' s ( mseb ) revenue collections in march 2001 stood at a record rs 968 crore . this was largely due to the disconnection drive on defaulter connections - - pegged at nearly 20 , 000 disconnections a month - - which resulted in compliance by consumers . with the dabhol power company ( dpc ) monthly financial burden issue now a topic of discussion among arbitrators on the negotiating table , the mseb has turned to putting its house in order .  as if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termed as the facilitator to the entire dpc tariff crisis , the state electricity board has put matters relating to its performance on record . for instance , mseb has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended march 31 , 2001 , at 45930 units , compared with the previous year ' s 45582 units , making it the top seb of the country in this respect . similarly its power stations recorded the highest availability percentage at 86 . 1 up from 84 . 6 per cent last fiscal . plant load factor is up to 72 . 78 per cent , compared with 71 . 7 per cent in 2000 .  the parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the ten years of its life time in 2000 at 4545 million units , which made it eligible for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guidelines issued by the government of india carrying a cash award of rs 12 . 5 lakh . all other power stations in the state , without exception , also fulfill the eligibility criteria for the cash award , a senior mseb official said . similarly , the chandrapur power station became the first power station of any state electricity board to get the iso 9002 certification .  a senior mseb official said : "" earlier mseb was suffering from too much interference in its day to day functioning . the agriculturists were touted as the major reason for its deteriorating accruals , while theft of electricity during the transmission and distribution stage was conveniently camouflaged under this head . in the recent past , the government has authorised mseb to take steps to curb this misuse of power by its own officials , many of whom , including a chief engineer have suffered suspensions",0

'  state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz  the economic times , friday apr 27 2001  dpc board empowers md to cancel mseb contract  the enron power project crisis on thursday deepened with the board of dabhol power company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board even while international lenders to the project asked enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed with the mseb .  the decision to authorise managing director neil mcgregor to issue "" notice of termination on the contract to sell 740 mw of power "" was taken after the board prevented mseb from voting on the ground that it was an interested party . the decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single opposition vote was cast by idbi , sources said .  according to reports , financial institutions such as anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , citibank , abn - amro and the state bank of india have on wednesday advised enron against terminating its ppa with mseb . mseb chairman vinay bansal , who with two other directors attended the meeting on wednesday representing maharashtra ' s 15 per cent stake in the near $ 3 - billion project , said : "" the indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if enron broke the contract . "" while bansal declined comment on the board decision , the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the state . ( pti )  the economic times , friday apr 27 2001  mseb pays rs 134 cr under ' protest ' to dpc  despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of rs 134 crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dabhol . "" we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself , but dpc officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh "" , a senior mseb official said . "" we have disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore and it would be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members "" , mseb sources said .  last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that it would not accept "" protest payments "" anymore . cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the "" purported protest or reservation "" . mseb had paid a rs 113 . 5 crore february bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the multinational ' s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state government . ( pti )  business standard , friday , april 27 , 001  enron india md authorised to terminate ppa  the board of the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) , at its meeting in london on wednesday , authorised the managing director of enron india to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra state electricity board and the state government . "" the board has authorised wade cline to serve the termination notice . however , this does not mean that the termination notice will be served immediately . it is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises , "" a state government source told business standard from london . he said dpc was under pressure from its lenders .  the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue . the hardening of the board ' s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc ' s lenders , who had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice . the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage . serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders , who have an exposure of about $ 2 billion in the project . sources said given the lenders ' strong opposition to termination of the contract , the enron board ' s "" enabling resolution "" did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio . the maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice . the state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract .  enron holds 65 per cent in dpc , while us - based ge and bechtel hold 10 per cent each . the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose vehicle , maharashtra power development corporation . the mseb representatives were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party . the idbi representative protested against the board ' s decision . the meeting was attended by state energy secretary vm lal . the meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills .  after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill , dpc invoked the state government ' s guarantee and then the union government ' s counter guarantee . when payment of the rs 127 - crore january bill became overdue , dpc again invoked the state government ' s guarantee . mseb retaliated on january 28 , 2001 by slapping a rs 401 - crore penalty for non - supply of electricity at adequate levels . it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against this penalty . "" this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting "" , a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb ' s stand and refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration between the centre and dpc is currently on .  the financial express , friday , april 27 , 2001  foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog & raghu mohan  global banks comfortable with enron pull - out  lenders to the dabhol power company ( dpc ) are a sharply divided lot . international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the industrial develoment bank of india ( idbi ) , are categorical that additional assistance to dpc ' s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) within the next four weeks . this follows the authorisation given to enron india ' s managing director k wade cline and dpc president & ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer notices to mseb , following wednesday ' s dpc board meeting in london .  the essence of the message from the international lenders following the london meeting with dpc board is : emotions do not work . contractual obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc ' s debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is . however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a messy affair .  sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect their interests more given that they have no security - other than assets - like a sovereign cover . "" it was this desperation that made local lenders like idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5 per cent , "" a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were : a ) there are contractual obligations b ) mseb was not punctual in its payments to dpc and c ) mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power .  while local lenders led by idbi - with mseb parroting the same - were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present form . the points of contention are : a ) that phase - i of dpc is backed by a sovereign guarantee b ) phase - ii is not and c ) to the extent that phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets - even those under phase - i - getting attached . therefore , an examination on the segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted .  pti adds : in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday .  the indian express , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron : dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb  the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp , has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) that it intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo neil mcgregor and enron india ' s managing director k wade cline to serve a ' ' preliminary ' ' termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power $ 48 million for power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid $ 24 million for february . and a payment of $ 31 million was made for march on thursday .  the $ 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision as a ' ' procedural ' ' move consistent with dpc ' s negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the mseb .  after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated , the government of india will have to take a hit of $ 300 million besides paying bills of rs 1 , 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty . ' ' our ( centre ' s ) liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million , ' ' power secretary a k basu said . ' ' contractually , the centre will have to pay one year ' s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , 400 - 1 , 500 crore , and take over dpc ' s debt , which stands at around $ 300 million , if the project was terminated , ' ' basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of completing the second phase of the 2 , 184 - megawatt power - plant project , which is 95 per cent through .  while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had strongly opposed dpc ' s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices for termination .  mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar - both directors on the dpc board - and the state principal secretary ( energy ) vm lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly ' ' threatening ' ' to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra - a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war , coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc ' s move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers .  the hindu , friday , april 27 , 2001  offer of renegotiation ' too late ' : enron , by mahesh vijapurkar  mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board , has decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa .  as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , ` ` it is not sudden death of the project ' ' and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . ` ` this would only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved ' ' . apparently , the dpc intends to do some arm - twisting .  at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the offer of renegotiation had come rather ` ` too late ' ' . it also said it did not see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon .  the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc would not take any ` ` harsh step ' ' which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation was the requirement and not confrontation .  echo in ls  the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister , mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs . 2 , 840 crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the centre ' s liability in case of termination is one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million .  blow to fis  the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial institutions ( fis ) which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the centre or the state .  the times of india , friday , 27 april 2001  enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait  the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet , considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders ' consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project . the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a move .  another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms . institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package , which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . ` ` the board has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , ' ' said mseb chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . ` ` mseb presented their views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings . ` ` we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable , "" bansal added .  ` ` they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction , ' ' said a top banker who was present during the lenders ' meet . ` ` there is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , ' ' he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india , where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings .  meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa . ` ` we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , ' ' deshmukh said . deshmukh was echoing union power minister suresh prabhu ' s sentiments , who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however , added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $ 2 . 9 billion project would be a blow to india ' s efforts to woo foreign investors .  the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december 2000 and january 2001 . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest payment , despite the dispute over the amount .  when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc .  the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , 2001  dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice  the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) has authorised the managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) ` ` at an appropriate time ' ' . the decision was taken at a board meeting held in london yesterday . ` ` while mseb , which is an ` interested party ' , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter , ' ' a senior state government official said .  the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a six - month ` ` suspension period ' ' . according to clause 17 . 8 of the termination procedure , of the ppa : ` ` following the giving of a preliminary termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months ( or such longer period as they may agree ) as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances . . . ' '  idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however , domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa is abandoned mid - way .  according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . ` ` the dpc will now have to decide what is the ` appropriate time ' to serve the notice , ' ' the official said . mseb pays rs 134 crore : meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs 134 crore towards its march 2001 bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was paid ` in protest ' ' today morning . ` ` they ( dpc ) had billed us for an amount of rs 146 crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , ' ' a senior mseb official said .  the pioneer , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron testing maharashtra ' s nerves , t n raghunatha  dabhol power company ( dpc ) has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) , the maharashtra state government and the centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the dpc board of directors ' decision to authorise its managing director to serve a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication .  the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , 840 crore on the centre . the decision to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of "" interested party "" .  when contacted , the company ' s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal , declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board . "" we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london . we will express our views after a few days , "" he said . however , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board ' s decision as "" unfortunate "" . "" we have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision "" , mr deshmukh said in mumbai .  official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board ' s decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state electricity board . the sources said that the dpc ' s reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of the power contract with the mseb .  "" if anything , the dpc ' s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb , the centre and the state government , "" the sources said . not surprisingly , the dpc ' s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government ' s decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron ' s subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dpc .  riday , april 27  the telegraph , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron signal to switch off dabhol power  enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol power company when it won an authorisation from the company ' s board to stop sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) .  the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65 per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre ' s liability , if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year ' s power bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . however , the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if enron walks out . "" we do not see fdi inflows into the power sector being hit , "" power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the decision coincided with a rs 134 - crore ' protest payment ' by the cash - strapped power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 . 64 crore .  there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers at enron ' s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide bandh . "" we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up at the dispute - resolution forum , "" a board official said . last week , dpc told the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position .  mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions are not covered under the centre ' s and state ' s counter - guarantees , unlike those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh called enron ' s decision unfortunate . "" we had told state government officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties . ""  the statesman , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron threatens to pull out  the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $ 2 . 9 billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of dabhol ' s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state electricity board , mr vinay bansal .  while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu , who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday .  the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr suresh prabhu , contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 . 7 per cent of the total energy output of the country , its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation .  however , if terminations proceedings go through , enron corp , a 65 per cent share - holder in the dabhol power company , would stand to net a hefty amount in damages . the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 , 800 crore , which is the total of one years ' electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . according to an energy analyst , mr pradyumna kaul , the total liability would not cross rs 350 crore . however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 , 840 crore . it is learnt that on 20 april , mr deshmukh had given the go - ahead to the mseb to prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc ' s board of directors on wednesday . at the meeting , the energy minister , padamsinh patil , energy secretary , mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr vinay bansal , were also present . the notice was prepared over the past weekend and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april . however , the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough , given its huge stake in the project , and that such a notice would not be necessary . the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff , with enron ' s consent .  among those present at the london meeting were mr lal , mr bansal and mseb technical director , mr p paunikar , in their capacity as directors . however , they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party . the only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also represented on the board , it is learnt . the chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , said the state was not in favour of terminating the project . this could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm - twist the indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months cleared . the mseb owes enron rs 146 . 64 crore for march 2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001 . the centre today put up a brave face on enron ' s decision saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country , pti reported from new delhi .  "" there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or foreign company . as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on fdi in power sector , "" power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when asked about dpc ' s decision to authorise management to issue a termination notice to mseb . emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision , prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs "" we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as european nations in the power sector . "" in fact not only the power minister but also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector . ""  mid day  ' dpc may not wind up '  maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor , managing director of the dabhol power corporation ( dpc ) , has been given complete powers with regard to dpc ' s operations in the state , including the authority to wind up operations , it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor will issue such a termination notice . mcgregor was given the powers at a meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday . ranganathan said that state officials , including maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) chairman vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal , have reported back to him about the meeting in london .  with regard to the state ' s failure to pay enron , ranganathan said , "" bills are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) and dpc owes some money to us . our people informed enron officials about this . . in fact , there was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice . "" in the london meeting , mseb and industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could not supply power whenever needed .  chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the enron - promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to wind up operations . deshmukh added , "" we have already requested enron not to take any harsh decision . "" deshmukh had earlier said , "" we have directed state government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state , as it would be harmful to both of us . ""  enron officials are keeping mum on the issue . mcgregor said , "" i am not going to give any comment . ""  mid day , april 27 , 2001  enron offers ' no comment ' on renegotiation , h s rao  a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company ( dpc ) , promoted by the us energy major enron , was held here yesterday apparently to discuss fate of its $ 900 - million power project in maharashtra , but there was no official word on the indian and state governments ' decision to renegotiate the contract .  an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting , saying the issues discussed at the meeting were ' confidential ' . "" we have not received any direct communication . unless we get it and evaluate the details , we have no comments to make , "" the spokesman said when asked about the proposed decision on re - negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) has 15 per cent stake .  asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india , the spokesman said he had nothing to say on them . enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to look at various options including selling the company ' s stake in dpc . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company . he said the maharashtra government "" is not in favour of terminating the 2184 - mw project , but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio . ""  mid day , friday , april 27 , 2001 ,  committee to renegotiate enron deal  a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power company will be appointed by this evening , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said today . addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha , deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow , at the most . he termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with power company .  "" renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee . we don ' t want to take any hasty decision , "" deshmukh saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably . when pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite state  s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee , chief minister said it was unfortunate .  earlier , in his meeting with hazare , deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people . he also gave a patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months .  afternoon , april 27 , 2001  ' enron ' s on ! '  state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz  the us power giant , enron power corporation ' s willingness to wrap up the dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise , though the dabhol power company chief , mr . wade cline , has been authorised to do so , since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter .  disclosing this , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power project at dabhol could be continued , and at the same time enron did not feel slighted . "" enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision . we are waiting for their letter , "" he said . when asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge , mr . deshmukh said , "" let our officers come back . after that we will decide a future course of action . but we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project . it is very difficult to predict the outcome of enron ' s decision but as of now the project is still on . "" when asked whether the project could be moved to another state , if wound up from maharashtra , mr . deshmukh said , that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government . however , it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself , he indicated . he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses if the project was terminated .  the board of directors of the dabhol power company , which met in london on wednesday , decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project , if he deemed it fit . however , this decision , as of now , does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project . the enron project , which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception , had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time . the previous sena - bjp government , which had been out to terminate the project , however , chose to continue with it following renegotiations with enron ' s top visiting officials like ms . rebecca mark . and , the democratic front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago .  meanwhile , state energy minister dr . padamsinh patil , when contacted at the osmanabad circuit house , said the state government and the central government have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with enron . "" it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that . they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both sides , "" he said . in case the project is terminated , the government can still manage the power needs of the state , though it would be a bit tough job , he added .",0

mail . my phone number is ( 617 ) 492 - 9551 .  i graduated from princeton university in 1996 ( mathematics ) , and came  straight to mit for a  ph . d . in operations management at the sloan schoolof management . in my first  three years i took all the required coursework in mathematics ,  optimization , stochastic processes , etc . , as well as a number of courses in  psychology ( at mit and harvard ) . i am working with prof . gabriel bitran ,  and i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations . in  particular , i am interested in the interaction between customers and  companies ( hence the interest in psychology ) . the ( tentative ) title of my  phd thesis is "" pricing substitute products on the internet "" , and i am  sending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few weeks ago that will  give you an idea of what this research is about .  thanks again , and i ' m looking forward to meeting you and your research  group next week .  paulo  pricing substitute products on the internet  objective :  to develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold  on  the internet .  motivation :  this research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and  optimization  models are not appropriate for internet - related businesses . the technological  innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of  information  which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices .  furthermore ,  companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can  have access to .  the problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue  faced  by internet companies . consumers usually search for generic products ( e . g .  vcrs  or computers ) without knowing exactly what they will buy . companies can show  different products and different prices to each consumer . this type of  flexibility  was not available until the internet came about .  the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the  methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of  other settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are  many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a  given company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer  to which customers and how much to charge for these services .  research strategy :  our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components  which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these  components are choice models and optimization models .  choice models :  choice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature  draws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the  common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic  elimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options  based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice  remains .  these methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very  easily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models  that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological  models .  the most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with  these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how  consumer make choices on the internet . the first step in our research will  be  to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between  customers  and companies on the internet .  optimization :  traditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a  certain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue  still exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term  profit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well you know  your customers and are able to retain them . the optimization problem must  therefore include a short term component ( sales ) and a long term component  ( learning ) .",0

"" the authority of ferc to set rates for power supplied under  emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do  not agree to a rate is explicitly included in fpa section 202 ( c ) . the doe  organization act of 1997 transferred the emergency powers of this section  from ferc to doe .  the 76 entities identified in the order ' s attachment are all the entities  that have provided power to the iso over the last 30 days . those entities  are ordered "" to make arrangements to generate , deliver , interchange , and  transmit electric energy when , as , and in such amounts as may be requested by  the "" iso , "" acting as agent for and on behalf of scheduling coordinators . ""  [ source : doe secretary richardson ' s december 14 , 2000 statement and order ;  electric power daily , december 15 , 2000 ]  ferc de - federalizes california markets , adopts other structural  reforms  a summary of the december 15 order and commission discussion  at its special meeting today , ferc unanimously approved its eagerly awaited  final order reforming the california wholesale markets , adopting the major  outlines of its november 1 proposed order and sending back to california the  responsibility for addressing state - related matters , as discussed below . at  the same time , ferc deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as  well as the imposition of region - wide price caps .  ferc reiterated the november 1 conclusions that under certain circumstances ,  california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates  due to california ' s "" seriously flawed "" market structure and rules in  conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the west .  while all four commissioners supported the order as a consensus - based outcome  that appropriately balanced all competing interests , each commissioner  expressed reservations with particular aspects of the order . chairman  hoecker and comm . breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement , while comms .  hebert and massey laid out their positions where they believed the commission  had either "" over - reached "" or not gone far enough , just as they did on  november 1 , as discussed below .  highlights of key actions :  ( 1 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to eliminate , effective immediately ,  the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s investor - owned utilities  buy and sell electricity through the px , and allow these utilities to  purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative  mechanisms to manage supply risks . ferc terminated the px ' s rate schedules  effective at the close of business on april 30 , 2001 . in effect , as chairman  hoecker stated , the order de - federalizes 60 percent of the california  wholesale market established under the state ' s restructuring law , returning  ratemaking authority over company - owned generation to the california public  utilities commission ( cpuc ) .  ( 2 ) ferc modified the effective period of the november 1 $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap ""  proposal , limiting its application through april 2001 , whereupon a  "" comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which  incorporates appropriate thresholds , screen and mitigation measures "" must be  in place . in a related move , ferc ordered a technical conference early next  year to develop such a program by march 1 , 2001 , so that these measures can  be place by the may 1 , deadline .  in a major modification , ferc revised the refund conditions to clarify that  while certain refund conditions will continue to apply , unless ferc issues  written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under  review , refund potential on a transaction will close after 60 days .  as proposed , however , supply bids in excess of $ 150 will be prohibited from  setting the market - clearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above  $ 150 / mwh will be required to report their bids to ferc on a confidential ,  weekly basis and provide certain cost support .  ( 3 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require the establishment of  independent , non - stakeholder governing board for the iso . the iso governing  board must relinquish their decision - making power and operating control to  the iso management on january 29 , 2001 . a future order will set procedures  for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process .  ( 4 ) in a major modification , ferc adopted a $ 74 / mwh "" price benchmark "" for  assessing prices of five - year energy supply contracts . this benchmark will  be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of  pricing long - term contracts .  to facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable  rates , ferc announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market  participants .  ( 5 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require market participants to  schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day - ahead market and  instituting a penalty charge for under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent  of hourly load requirements ) , in order to discourage over - reliance on the  real - time spot market .  ( 6 ) ferc directed the iso and the three investor - owned utilities to file  generation interconnection standards .  ( 7 ) ferc affirmed the longer - term measures proposed in the november 1 order ,  including submission of a congestion management design proposal by april 2 ,  2001 .  ( 8 ) ferc deferred resolving key issues , including establishing new iso board  selection procedures , developing appropriate market monitoring measures and  negotiating protective orders associated with data collection .  ( 9 ) ferc reiterated its november 1 call to california policy makers there to  resolve state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability  of day ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand  responses ; ( 3 ) siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of  sufficient reserve requirements .  commissioner responses  comm . hebert reluctantly concurred , calling the final order a "" missed  opportunity "" to , among other things , send appropriate signals for new  generation siting and conservation . reiterating his november 1 concerns ,  hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the commission  should and should not have adopted . while expressing pleasure at the tone of  the order ( "" balanced and considerate "" ) , the bid certainly reversal , and the  role reserved for the state in the selection of the new iso board , hebert  nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order , which  he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low . hebert faulted the commission  for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the november 8 order  approving the ca iso ' s emergency $ 250 / mwh "" soft cap "" proposal . hebert ended  by challenging the cpuc to do what it can to encourage utilities there to  forward contract , including easing the existing prudence review requirements .  comm . breathitt endorsed the order , reiterating her support for progress  towards open and competitive markets . she noted that the order properly  "" walked the line "" by taking all of the competing interests into account ,  calling it less than ideal , but a step in the right direction . she also  concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will  be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of  the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint . additionally she mentioned that any price below the  $ 74 / mwh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable .  comm . massey concurred , but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for  california ratepayers , stating that he felt that market power had been  exercised , that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers  had profited too much at the expense of others in the market . he warned  that , as he understood the legal precedents , the federal courts were poised  to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on  to consumers . on the positive side , he approved of the de - federalization of  60 % of the market and the creation of long term contracts . however , he  emphasized that california regulators must now take the responsibility of  creating more generation and transmission . in the long term , comm . massey  hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference  and that the market would have rules more like pjm .  finally , comm . massey articulated what he would have liked to have done  differently . he stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not  enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the  on - going investigation . he also disagreed with the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint ,  preferring instead a hard price per generator . the commissioner said he  would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and  that he would have opened a section 206 investigation in the west . finally ,  he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds .  chairman hoecker began his comments by saying that the commission was forced  to act and act quickly because the stakes are so high . he feels that it is  now time for the state regulators and markets to act . he noted that by  shrinking the cal px , the responsibility is now with the cpuc to fashion the  long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the  least amount of damage to the utilities . in regards to suggestions for a  regional price cap , the chairman stated that this would not work due to the  fact that the commission has no jurisdiction over bonneville , wapa and the  public power producers and that there is no spot market in the northwest .  however , he did urge secretary richardson to convene a conference in order to  address regional issues . finally , in conceptually addressing the california  situation , the chairman stated that competition or "" deregulation "" did not  fail in california , but that there never was competition in california .",0

"Subject: energy leader consulting generation evaluator ( ege )  shirley :  as requested , herein is information regarding the meeting with vince kaminski .  the presentation on the ege tool ' s applications and the allegheny energy case study is timed to take an hour . if the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for tuesday , may 29 , might i request it be set for late afternoon ( as my other appointments are the next day ) .  and , as vince will recall , i was co - leader of the energy consulting business of phb hagler bailly , and developer of the ramp up , real time , 75 check and electric strategy tools . presently , i am ceo of energy leader consulting ( elc ) .  background  the u . s . power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years . rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively . utilities , who still control most power plants , endeavor to adopt the entrants ' methods . yet , inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread .  utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades - old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling . many utilities , notwithstanding the industry - wide trend towards profit maximization , cling to ingrained routines .  inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale . a utility may operate a relatively small system ( fewer than a dozen plants ) . a small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers , playing the wholesale market at the margin .  for a variety of reasons , utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units , let alone shut down any ( even temporarily or seasonally ) . economically inefficient units continue to be committed , week after week , and run in the half - load range .  ege objectives  ege identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines . taking into account transmission and reliability factors , the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant .  i . an industry participant can use ege as a basis for a medium or long - term wholesale power transaction with a utility ; or to price wholesale power more aggressively , to take market share from the utility ( i . e . , compel changes in unit commitment habits ) .  ii . an industry participant can use ege to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition .  iii . a power plant developer can use ege to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility ' s unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized .  specific ege concepts  ege reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities .  it produces indicative statistics such as :  a . the frequency distribution of starts per week ;  b . the frequency distribution of starts by day / 15 - minute segment during the week ;  c . the frequency distribution of load level ;  d . the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start ;  e . average heat rate and approximate fully - allocated cost in the half - load range ;  f . average ramp rate from the half - load range ;  g . the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours ; and  h . forced - off maintenance outage rate ( where indicated ) .  indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month / year ; in some cases , by temperature range . ( they can be by regional wholesale prices as well . ) ege establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years .  ege is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data . ege is now updated for the 4 th quarter 2000 ( through december 31 , 2000 ) . ege lst quarter 2000 ( through march 31 , 2001 ) will be available approximately june 15 , 2001 .  ege also compares and ranks generating units ' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility ( as well as other regional generators ) . some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half - load level for lengthy time periods ( without an apparent reliability basis ) , splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units .  other ege supporting data :  i . planned maintenance schedule ( where indicated ) ;  j . actual maximum generating capacity ;  k . actual minimum generating capacity ( actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government - reported values ) ;  l . average heat rate in the full - load range ; and  m . average heat rate in the three - quarter - load range .  with respect to a generating units ' average heat rate in the half - load , three - quarter - load and full - load ranges , it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region . it can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities , and changes in recent years in these parameters .  the real - world example of allegheny energy  allegheny energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of ege . in the 4 th quarter 2000 , for instance , one high - cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning ( 52 times ) and committed for the whole day ( in all but two cases ) . arguably , there are power products that could substitute for this routine ( in part at least ) at a profit to the seller of the product and allegheny energy .  another high - cost allegheny energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn ( nine times ) and committed for most of the coming week . at another plant , two high - cost units were operated too often in the expensive half - load range ( some 550 hours ) and three - quarter - load range ( another 400 to 600 hours ) ; they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels . again , there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to allegheny energy .  offering of energy leader consulting ( elc )  ege is a procedure , not a software package or data base . elc believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities .  elc transfers its "" knowledge "" about the ege procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight - forward four - step process :  1 . enron would select one to three target utilities .  2 . elc would perform the ege procedure on the target utilities .  3 . employing this real - world analysis as a pedagogic tool , elc , in a one - day seminar with enron personnel , would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future ( without the assistance of elc ) .  4 . optionally , elc would provide ege supporting data , quarterly , to enron .  the basic ege supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program ( virtually all fossil fuel units ) . parameters that are incorporated , and the data set format , will be specified upon request . custom modifications will be considered .  steven a . mitnick  chief executive officer  energy leader consulting  4807 41 st street , nw  washington , dc 20016  ( 202 ) 997 - 0924 voice  ( 202 ) 537 - 0906 fax  smitnick @ energyleader . com",0

"Subject: alliance info alert  ferc acts to remove obstacles to address western energy crisis  * * omnibus order mobilizes ferc ' s entire energy pricing and infrastructure  authority  * * to adopt financial incentives for capacity increases in transmission  facilities  * * streamlines regulation of wholesale market , energy facilities siting and  licensing  * * promotes conservation and wholesale side of demand - response bidding  * * order doesn ' t address price caps  * * meeting with western state regulators / officials set for april 6 , 2001 in  boise , idaho  ferc moves to bring more economic and reliable energy supplies to the  stressed california and western energy markets . ferc proposes to increase  bulk power supply in the west by removing barriers and providing incentives  that are within its jurisdiction over facility certification , licensing , and  the regulation of transmission and wholesale power sales in interstate  commerce . ferc quickly wants to increase electric generation and  transmission capacity , as well as to streamline the regulation of wholesale  power transactions , as well as increase the capacity of the supporting  infrastructure of natural gas and oil pipelines . the order , which sets new  precedent in its broadness , also proposes actions to reduce electricity  demand in the west as well as promoting the necessary wholesale - market  portion of demand - response bidding where states wish to implement the retail  side . ferc asks for comments on additional actions it may take in the future  by march 30 , 2001 .  effective immediately , ferc said in a statement , * the commission is  streamlining regulatory procedures for wholesale electric power sales ,  expediting the certification of natural gas pipeline projects into california  and the west , including the reallocation of staff resources to more quickly  address pending pipeline applications , and urging all licensees to review  their ferc - licensed hydroelectric projects in order to assess the potential  for increased generating capacity . *  among the actions ferc takes are to : 1 ) require the california iso and  transmission owners within all 11 states of the western systems coordinating  council ( wscc ) to prepare a list of grid enhancements that can be completed  in the short term ; 2 ) waive prior notice requirements for any on - site or  self - generators that sell at wholesale within the wscc area ; 3 ) grant blanket  market - based rate authority for sales on the wholesale market of electric  energy that becomes available as a result of demand - response reductions in  retail and wholesale loads ; and 4 ) broadening and extending through december  31 , 2001 the temporary waivers of the operating and efficiency standards for  qualifying facilities ( qfs ) to increase the availability of generating  capacity .  ferc seeks comments by march 30 on a series of economic incentives aimed at  ensuring timely upgrades to the western transmission grid , including an  increased rate of return on equity ( roe ) for projects that significantly  increase transmission and can be in service by either june 1 , 2001 , or  november 1 , 2001 . other areas that ferc requested comment on include the use  of interconnection authority under the federal power act , and to raise the  dollar limits on the issuance of blanket certificates authorizing gas  pipeline construction . on hydro issues , ferc requested comment on ways to  increase operating flexibility at ferc - licensed projects while protecting  environmental resources .  in its effort to encourage investment in transmission infrastructure , ferc  asked for comments - again by march 30 - on a series of economic incentives  aimed at ensuring upgrades to the western interconnection , including the  increased roe for projects that significantly increase transmission on  constrained paths and can be in service by the above dates in 2001 .  increased roe , ferc said , will also be given to system upgrades over new  transmission paths that can be in service by june 1 , 2002 , or november 1 ,  2002 . ferc seeks comment on a proposed 10 - year depreciation period for  projects that increase transmission capacity in the short - term and a 15 - year  depreciation period for upgrades involving new rights - of - way that can be of  service by november 1 , 2002 .  in his dissent to the order , commissioner massey argued the order focuses on  "" quick fixes , "" and that the measures will not close the gap between supply in  demand in california . the order also "" fails to address price relief , "" noted  massey . massey also called for a full federal power act ( fpa ) section 206  investigation of california issues , which would allow for the possibility of  refunds . on transmission incentive provisions , massey lamented that the  proposed roe increase to 14 percent appeared arbitrary and inconsistent with  ferc policy under order no . 2000 . the financial provisions , he said ,  appeared to be "" just throwing money at the problem . "" while generally  disappointed with the order , massey did express limited support for many  parts of the order . many of the suggestions in the order are the "" same  actions as authorized last may , "" said massey . "" they were good ideas then ,  and they are good ideas now , "" he concluded .  for his part in comments at the open meeting when the order was adopted ,  chairman hebert said the order was designed to "" squeeze every additional mw  of supply available "" and to encourage the conservation of mw , and stressed  that ferc is "" doing all it can in its power to alleviate western problems . ""  he said the order seeks to eradicate the projected supply shortfall in  california , but noted that generation / transmission siting , and conservation  are generally state issues .  ferc ' s * removing obstacles * order is posted on its web site at :  citation : ferc issued is order removing obstacles to increased electric  generation and natural gas supply in the western united states and asking for  comments was issued on march 14 , 2001 , docket no . elol - 47 - 000 .  a detailed analysis and summary of the specific actions taken and proposals  made follows :  electric transmission infrastructure  within 30 days , the california iso and transmission owners in wscc are to  prepare and file for information purposes a list of grid enhancement projects  that may be underway or may not require initial siting and acquisition of  rights of way .  ferc proposes a scaled transmission infrastructure incentive under which  transmission owners of projects that increase transmission capacity at  present constraints and can be in service by july 1 , 2001 would receive a  cost - based rate reflecting a 300 basis point premium return on equity and a  10 - year depreciable life . projects in service by november 1 , 2001 , would get  a 200 basis point premium and 10 - year depreciable life . ferc would use a  uniform baseline return on equity for all jurisdictional transmission  providers in wscc of 11 . 5 % , based on the roe ferc approved for southern  california edison .  system upgrades that involve new rights of way , add significant transfer  capability and can be in service by november 1 , 2002 , would get a cost - based  rate reflecting 12 . 5 % roe , or al 00 basis point premium , and 15 - year  depreciable life .  facilities needed to interconnect new supply to the grid , which go into  service as required to accommodate the in - service date of the new plant would  get a cost - based rate that reflected a 13 . 5 % roe , or a 200 basis point  premium , if in service by november 1 , 2001 and 12 . 5 % roe if in service by  november 1 , 2002 .  for increases in transmission capacity on constrained interfaces that do not  involve significant capital investments , for example , installing new  technology , ferc proposes to allow transmission owners to increase the  revenue requirement of their network service rates to ensure that each  additional mw of capacity will generate revenues equal to their current firm  point - to - point rate . ferc requests comment on whether to assign the cost of  any interconnection or system upgrade to a particular load or supply , or  alternatively , to roll these costs into the average system rate .  extension of waivers for qfs  ferc proposes to extend its temporary waivers of operating and efficiency  standards for qfs - applicable throughout wscc - to allow increased  generation through december 31 , 2001 . the waivers were to expire on april  30 , 2001 . the proposed waiver would allow qualifying cogenerators to sell  their output above the level at which they have historically supplied this  output to purchasing utility . the waiver for qualifying small power  production facilities in wscc with respect to their fuel use requirements  under ferc regulation section 292 . 204 ( b ) , would be extended to december 31 ,  2001 .  additional capacity from on - site generation  ferc will adopt streamlined regulatory procedure to accommodate wholesale  sales from such facilities that serve load within wscc . through december 31 ,  2001 , owners of generating facilities located at business locations in wscc  and used primarily for back - up or self - generation who would become subject  to fpa by virtue of sales of such power will be permitted to sell power at  wholesale without prior notice under fpa section 205 . ferc also authorizes  such power to be sold at market - based rates . ferc waives its prior notice  requirement for mutually agreed upon interconnection agreements for  interconnections necessary to accomplish these sales . quarterly reporting is  required .  allows demand response bidding  ferc will allow retail customers , as permitted by state law , and wholesale  customers to reduce consumption for the purpose of reselling their load  reduction at wholesale . ferc is granting blanket authorization , consistent  with its prior discussion on sales from on - site generation and requires  similar reporting .  ferc ' s december 15 order on the california market directed , as a longer - term  measure that the iso pursue establishing an integrated day - ahead market in  which all demand and supply bids are addressed in one venue . ferc seeks  comments on the desirability of accelerating action on this .  ferc says it realizes that states play an important role in regulating retail  electric service and that allowing retail load to reduce consumption for  resale in wholesale markets raises legal , commercial , technical and  regulatory issues . safeguards may be needed to protect and enhance retail  demand - response bidding programs . intention is not to undermine state  programs but to promote the necessary complementary wholesale programs .  requests comments on how helpful this action is and how it can be  accomplished consistent with state jurisdiction over retail sales .  contract modifications for demand - response bidding  there may be opportunities for public utilities to make other types of  demand - response arrangements with their wholesale customers . as for mutually  agreeable qf interconnections , ferc will waive prior notice requirement for  any mutually agreeable demand - response related rate schedule amendments that  may be required to effectuate these arrangements . clarifies that  demand - response program costs should be treated consistently with all other  types of incremental and out - of - pocket costs .  interconnections  fpa section 210 ( d ) allows ferc to issue an order requiring interconnection if  it makes a finding that such an order : 1 ) is in the public interest ; 2 ) would  encourage overall conservation of energy or capital , optimize the efficiency  of use of facilities and resources , or improve the reliability of any  electric utility system or federal power marketing agency to which the order  applies ; and 3 ) meets the requirements of fpa section 212 .  ferc requests comments on whether it can use this authority under fpa section  210 ( d ) to alleviate existing impediments to electricity reaching load . if  the exercise of this authority may be warranted , ferc seeks comments on  whether it could make some of the required findings generically for the wscc  region in order to respond quickly should circumstances arise requiring  immediate action .  longer term regional solutions  ferc believes an rto for the entire western region or the seamless  integration of western rtos is the best vehicle for designing and  implementing a long - term regional solution .  natural gas pipeline capacity  ferc has realigned its resources to respond to new applications for gas  pipeline capacity and is soliciting comments on ways to expedite the approval  of pipeline infrastructure needed to serve california and the west . requests  comments on how it might further exercise its authority over new pipeline  construction to alleviate the present crisis , including increasing the dollar  limit thresholds for blanket certificates to $ 10 million , and for prior  notice authorizations to $ 30 million in order to increase the facilities  qualifying for automatic authorization ; offering blanket certificates for  construction or acquisition of portable compressor stations to enhance  pipeline capacity to california ; and offering rate incentives to expedite  construction of projects that will make additional capacity available this  summer on constrained pipeline systems .  hydroelectric power  ferc staff will hold a conference to discuss methods to address environmental  protection at hydro projects while allowing increased generation . requests  comments on ways to allow for greater operating flexibility at  commission - licensed hydro projects while protecting environmental resources .  comments should consider : 1 ) methods for agency involvement ; 2 ) ways to  handle and expedite endangered species act consultations ; 3 ) criteria for  modifying licenses ; and 4 ) identification of processes that could be  implemented to provide efficiency upgrades .  oil pipelines  ferc will explore with oil pipelines innovative proposals that could lead to  ensuring an adequate flow of petroleum product into the california market .  conference with state commissioners  ferc will hold a one - day conference with state commissioners and other state  representatives from western states to discuss price volatility in the west  as well as other ferc - related issues identified by the governors of western  states . by notice issued march 16 , this meeting is scheduled for april 6 ,  2001 in boise , idaho .

( popt ) and roxxy corporation announced that the  companies have entered into a letter of intent whereby roxxy corporation will  acquire a 66 % interest in pop 3 ' s wholly owned subsidiary , viastar  distribution group , inc . "" vdg , "" forming a revolutionary new music company ,  controversial entertainment corporation . the transaction , consisting of  stock and cash , when completed , will provide pop 3 ' s shareholders with a  33 % stake in the new company .  roxxy ' s management will operate the company from headquarters in los  angeles and will change its corporate name to controversial entertainment  corporation in the coming weeks . the companies intend to complete and  execute the definitive agreement by july 8 th , 2005 , and seek shareholder  approval immediately thereafter .  pop 3 ' s ceo , john d . aquilino , stated , "" this alliance will allow pop 3 to  achieve its strategic vision of creating a new paradigm in the music  industry . one that is focused on supporting the artist and the music they  create while embracing emerging technologies and giving consumers  access to a variety of artists through a variety of media . ""  roxxy ' s management team combines highly experienced industry executives  drawn from the major labels and also includes a staff of in - house  producers who are among the most influential talents in the music industry  today .  "" it is roxxy ' s vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major  labels ' lack of commitment to their artists and customers ; labels that  cast aside established artists who can no longer generate multi - million  selling recordings , but who consistently release albums which sell  hundreds of thousands of records to a large and loyal fan base ; artists  that can easily generate revenues between $ 1 and $ 5 million per title , ""  stated john shebanow , roxxy ' s ceo .  "" additionally , the acquisition of vdg will provide us with the ability  to distribute our own product directly to retail to over 22 , 000 retail  location in north america , effectively doubling the company ' s net  profit margins and allowing the increased revenue to pass on to our  artists . ""  mr . shebanow concluded , "" while there are smaller labels that do provide  a home for these acts , they lack either the will or financial resources  to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the caliber we have  on staff require . and no company has the unique combination of great  producers , in - house distribution and dedication to the artist and the  customer that controversial entertainment will possess .

"Subject: capital hill gold - chgi - potential high grade gold deposit  breaking news : denver , june 14 , 2005 ( business wire ) - - capital hill gold , inc , ( chgi ) reports that the company ' s geologists are evaluating a potential high - grade bulk - tonnage gold deposit located in mineral county , nevada , the project is situated in the vicinity of several operating and past - producing gold mines , including the paradise peak , santa fe and rawhide deposits , after review of usgs geochemical survey work of the project and a study of the geology of other gold deposits in the area , geologists believe that the target would be a high - grade bulk - tonnage gold deposit ,  virgin deposits : the privately - held 440 - acre project was originally staked by a major gold mining company in the 1990 s , the property has never been drilled and may prove to be a rich vein as early tests have indicated , follow - up work by the company ' s geologist indicated that a major international gold mining company had staked approximately 200 unpatented lode - mining claims in the area during 2001 and 2002 ,  geologists investigating the property for capital hill observed multiple broad zones of silicification extending for considerable distances , samples were collected from several outcrops on the property , and have been submitted to american assay labs in elko , nevada for assaying , based on positive assay results , target and identification , a major claim - staking program will be launched accordingly , as further credible evidence emerges of a significant gold ore deposit , and the first results coming in are showing promise ,  on june 13 , 2005 the company announced in a press release that capital hill ' s management is pleased and encouraged with the first u 3 o 8 ( uranium oxide ) assay returns as well as the noticeable precious metal results and that initial reconnaissance sampling on the company ' s uranium project has returned assays grading 0 , 061 % u 3 o 8 to 0 , 068 % u 3 o 8 of great interest to the company is the fact that the samples taken also assayed positively for precious metals , with results ranging from 0 , 08 to 0 , 22 oz ag / st and trace amounts of gold , the occurrence of silver in conjunction with the uranium mineralization warrants further investigation .  the recent news of the company possibly sitting on a huge untapped gold deposit has the stock in a strong up trend , rallying from 5 cents to 75 cents during the past three months . as the three - month chart illustrates , trading volume has swelled to 300 , 000 shares per day with money flow indicators showing strong inflows , which is representative of a stock that is under accumulation . the positive tape action clearly shows strong investor sentiment about the company ' s leverage on controlling sizable parcels of gold fields . the potential recoverable gold data has yet to be compiled , but as mentioned above , early tests are very promising , which is why investors are bidding up shares ahead of this data .  capital hill gold ' s strategic objective is to obtain controlling interests in properties with excellent exploration potential to become economically significant to world - class ore deposits . chgi intends to acquire mineral exploration properties primarily through the filing of concessions on its own account and in partnership as well as by optioning exceptional properties at reasonable costs relative to the property ' s potential and the financial capabilities of the company .  in recent weeks , chgi shareholders have been on the receiving end of some very promising developments with the new discoveries for gold ore . in addition , the company is aggressively exploring for commercial grade uranium deposits that will supply newly heightened demand from nuclear utilities . since 2003 uranium prices have doubled . 20 % of the world ' s electricity comes from uranium , and the nuclear power plant count is stable and growing . the united states needs to add about 100 nuclear power plants over the next two decades to meet burgeoning demand for electric power and maintain the current generating mix , nils j . diaz , chairman of the u . s . nuclear regulatory commission told reporters in early may 2005 .  as of may 17 , 2005 the company is pleased to report that the claim staking crew and geologist have arrived on site , and have begun staking claims . the area being staked encompasses a large area of potentially commercial - grade uranium mineralization identified by previous work , including geophysical surveys . reconnaissance sampling of the ground being staked has returned assay results approximately equal to those of in - place resources at one of the past - producing uranium mines in the project area .  a chinese news web site reports that china , the world ' s second - largest energy consumer after the u . s . , will spend 400 billion yuan ( u . s . $ 48 . 33 billion ) on building new nuclear power plants by 2020 . this is a bigger number than we have seen in the past . the energy - hungry country intends to increase the amount of installed nuclear power capacity from the current 16 gigawatts to 40 gigawatts within 15 years . nuclear power generation is expected to triple to reach 60 gigawatts by that time . so the market for uranium is in a new bull market .  conclusion  development efforts for gold and uranium on chgi properties are about to commence following the better - than - expected geophysical testing results . shares of chgi have rallied over 10 - fold in just the past three months in anticipation of what the future holds in the way of extractible gold and uranium . once full mining operations are under way , it is our view , that the shares will rally as the business generates its initial revenue stream .  for additional information , visit  investor relations solutions is a communications arm of ir solutions profiles . investor relations solutions is not licensed by any governmental or regulatory agencies and is not a registered investment advisor , financial planning service or a stock brokerage firm and in accordance with such , investor relations solutions is not offering investment advice or promoting any investment strategies . investor relations solutions is not offering securities for sale or solicitation of any offer to buy or sell securities . this stock advertisement or e -

( f - pcr ) technology uses live animal blood to detect the presence of infectious diseases and for the development of vaccines for such blood born diseases . it also allows for the efficient , effective , and continuous testing , management and treatment of animal populations . these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today - - all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds . our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals , but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines .  to date , genethera has successfully developed the assay ability to detect mad cow and chronic wasting disease , a disease affecting elk and deer in north america . diagnostic assays for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease are in the final stages of development . vaccines for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease , both of which are diseases affecting cattle , are in advanced stages of development . in the future , the company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases / animals , the immediate targets being mad cow , hoof mouth , west nile and newcastle .  genethera can detect bse using the companies patented live animal blood test that evaluates the e . d . r . f . gene sequence . the e . d . r . f . gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any tse infection is noticeable in a live animal or human . the patent gtha holds is broad based and can detect all tse diseases including mad cow ( bse ) in cattle , cwd in elk deer and creutzfeld - jacobs in humans  the company ' s patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost . the test can also be used on a mass scale using roche f - pcr , dna analyzing robotics equipment . genethera can analyze over 2000 blood samples a day with one f - pcr machine and a single technician . the project will prove highly profitable at approx $ 4 . 00 per test when wide scale commercialization is under way .  a multi - billion dollar , international demand for commercial mad cow testing has emerged around the globe .  japan conducted 3 million post - mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone . they used the western blot developed by prionics ag in swizterland and bio - rad ' s rapid test . costs are between $ 20 and $ 40 dollars per test . most importantly , other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed . testing through post - mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly .  japan spent between $ 60 million - $ 120 million on 3 million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in 2004 .  genethera ' s simple blood test can be collected using their patented field collection system . the sample is then mailed to the lab for testing . the company also stated in their recent 10 k that they are currently in negotiations with strategic testing partners that we believe will absorb the costs of commercializing our live animal mad cow test .  management :  dr . tony milici -

"" ? ? .  anyway :  i think he would be a good fit withing the group . krisna has offered to hire  him in the research group , he has good programing background and is excited  about working for enron instead of a utility such as pacificcorp . he  expressed interest in applying his skill to make $ $ $ $ .  i suggest bringing him in in research as a first alternative . i see three  potential applications where we can use his skills to evaluate best longer  term fit :  continuing ronnie ' s model building role , but with a focus within neil ' s group  to tie rm systems together  bridge the lack of phd econometrics expertise we have as are result of the  departure of anoush .  risk management systems infrastructure development .  scott stoness  05 / 19 / 2000 02 : 02 pm  to : james w lewis / hou / ees @ ees  cc : dennis benevides / hou / ees @ ees  subject : ming sit  he is no replacement for jay but he could be a dennis b employee .  pros :  engineer so would be good at math  his boss hired him a 2 nd time ( 1 at txu and again at pacificor again ) so he  must be reliable  phd in economics and engineering ( good ) from stanford ( ugh : ) : ) : ) )  cons :  does not understand tariffs . i asked him and he said he is not experienced .  i probed too and he does not understand regulatory that well .  does not understand ancillary services ( which is surprising to me since he  started out as an plant operation side of hk power )  has limited people management skills ( he described 1 analyst he works with  that is not capable that he has to jump into the excel spreadsheet and fix it  for him and he cannot give him feedback because it is a utility mentality )  he is not a good communicator ( i asked him to describe what he did in hk  power and it took him forever to explain because he expected me to know that  plant operations meant planning the start up of oil plants ) .  overall :  i suspect that he is a very solid guy when it comes to analysis but not  particularly creative or good at communication and leadership . he would be a  great support person .  i would hire for analysis but not as a potential leader . go",0

"Subject: stephen bennett  stephen bennett , professional meteorologist , was hired into the research  group in september of this year as a specialist based on salary alignment  criteria . in retrospect , and upon review , he should have been hired on as a  senior specialist .  after coming on board . it rapidly became apparent that stephen was clearly an  "" under hire . "" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of  a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of  this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring  error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""  at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron  designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving  of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",0

( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ?  recently ,  we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and  how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the  next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could  have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all  over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became  obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to  bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics .  merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the  potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another  source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this  business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the  single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online  gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be  an ideal time to is time to invest .  we decided to  find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with  a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging ,  publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a  close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months .  although  ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at  the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old .  the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno .  and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the  keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it  gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream  gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online  gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers  these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the  company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in  the investment community and driving up its stock price .  after a successful north american launch ,  gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese  and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business  decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest  source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach .  what  does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game ,  one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced  management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . .  to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more .  first source data inc .  4535 west sahara ave # 217  las vegas nevada 89102  disclosure and disclaimer  investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first  source data , inc .

"Subject: meeting for friday on storage  hi mark , i have not met you yet but heard a lot of good things about you . i  would like to discuss with you and possibly with john bloomer and richard  reichardt about the ebs research ' s role in supporting the storage market  development from the origination and trading perspective . there are several  people in various groups that are talking about storage but here is what ' s my  take on our involvement - - please correct me or suggest otherwise .  shalesh ganjoo is our lead analyst on this effort . in addition to his effort  with your group , he is presently supporting jean mrha with pricing and  standardization for a traded storage maret - - stinson gibner is directly  supervising him in this effort .  shalesh came to us through referal from david cox - - david discovered him at  one of his speaking engagements . shalesh had talked to david about traded  storage market development some time last october and david refered shalesh  to enron research group . we hired shalesh for general analyst position and  now he is pulled into all aspect of this storage effort . currently , he is  our point person ( with stinson or i supervising his effort ) who is supporting  jean mrha and you on the subject . kara knop has aproached shalesh with  request for some support and shalesh and she are sorting out each other  , s  role in this regard . as per my discussion today with david , we need to  coordinate this storage effort from the perspective of modeling market  assessment etc . for this i suggest shalesh and his effort so that all parties  involved can benefit from collective effort within one central source . based  on david ' s and my assessment of shalesh ' s capabilities , i would like to  suggest that the commercial heads use shalesh for his creative thinking ,  understanding of the market and analytical capabilities and not just for data  gathering and simple research effort . we can add other staff as we see the  need and as you request them .  please respond this e - mail with your comments if this sounds like aplan , so  that we can support this effort efficiently and in a scalable manner .  kind regards ,  ravi .  a bit about ebs research group  john bloomer and richard reichardt have met me and are aware of my role and  stinston gibner ' s role in ebs . i lead a team of quantitative professionals  via a group we are calling ebs research . this group reports to stinson  gibner ( vp ) and vince kaminski ( md and head of enron research ) . stinson and  vince are the original founders of enron corp research that has been charged  with model development efforts to support enron energy trading and other  enron business . enron research is involved in all aspects of enron buinesses  ( ees , international , corporate affairs such as fas 133 and other accounting  and new product ( derivatives ) development , etc . ) .  within ebs research , there serveral professionals supporting kevin howard  ( cfo office ) , john griebling , tom gros and jean mrha , david cox ( via boris ) ,  and the war room . our main area of focus is with jean mrha ( trading ) and  john griebling ( optical network design and optimization , etc . ) . we play a  key role with john griebling ' s go forward network design and implementation  through our responsiblity to provide traffic engineering analysis and  modeling effort .  - - - - - forwarded by ravi thuraisingham / enron communications on 03 / 08 / 00 09 : 31  am - - - - -  shalesh ganjoo @ ect  03 / 07 / 00 08 : 01 pm  to : mark s palmer / enron communications @ enron communications  cc : ravi thuraisingham / enron communications @ enron communications @ enron  subject : meeting for friday on storage  dear mark ,  i am looking forward to presenting my competitive analysis on the storage  market on friday to you and others . ravi thurasingham will be calling you to  find out if we ( research group ) can assist your group in any other way .  please let me know if you need any information before we meet . thank you .  sincerely ,  shalesh ganjoo",0
"Subject: pricing credit on thousands of names  all -  our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to  provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [ 5 , 000 by year - end ] .  most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information ,  making the challenge harder , and the end result more important in terms of  competitive pricing advantage . what we need is an overall strategy for how we  plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective .  currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under  development :  fmc model ( default probability approach ) . using bloomberg ' s fair market ( par  yield ) curves , probabilities are generated from the risky - libor , then  default / bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology .  fmc model ( credit spread approach ) . using the fmcs , then directly taking the  libor credit spread at each tenor , adjusting for basis and compounding  differences .  bond model ( fmc approach ) . taking the fmcs as benchmark curves , the model  regresses the input bonds ( specific to a name ) on the two best fitting  benchmarks . the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs ,  but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer . prices are then generated  using both spread and probability approaches . under testing .  bond model ( spline approach ) . taking only the bonds specific to an issuer ,  the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero - coupon price curve ,  then builds a zero yield curve from this . under testing .  market prices . for certain liquid names , or sectors / ratings , cds market  prices are used , then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap  prices .  kmv . using expected default frequencies ( edfs ) from the kmv model and  database , we will build a model to price default swaps , making appropriate  risk adjustments . kmv is being installed now , so model will be worked on next .  each of these models returns a price ( credit default and bankruptcy ) , and the  accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory  differences between bond and cds markets , recovery assumptions , risk premia ,  capital charges , etc . the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid  names as possible , based upon these models , then use these prices , alongside  other financial information , as the backbone to a full automated pricing  system .  our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and  market prices for all issuers , alongside name - specific ' soft ' data from  credit reports and financial statements . if the credit is liquid enough , a  price will be generated from their own information only . otherwise , the  credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits , with financial  information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights .  the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with  market ( or trader ) prices , and this adjustment will feed back into the  weighting and mapping composition . in loose terms , we could think of the  system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid  market prices ( bonds , equities , default swaps ) , where the weightings are  calibrated using credit analysis , financial ratios , etc .  the key steps to implementing such a system will be :  establishing what exactly we want to ' predict ' - is it a price , a rating , a  probability , or a score ? we will need a clean market history to calibrate to ,  which we only really have for ratings . we will then need to develop a mapping  from rating / score to price .  getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to  calibrate the model .  building the mechanics of the model , ie , the calibration methodology . neural  nets / fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates , but which exact methods and  software packages to use ?  determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited  information into the model .  getting the "" true "" market price , in order to feed back an error . at present  such a price exists for very few credits .  allocating resources to the development . mckinsey claimed such a system would  take 6 - 10 man - months to develop .  further ideas or comments are requested , as we need to develop our strategy  asap . the model description above is fairly vague , as we don ' t yet have the  knowledge needed to fill in the specific details . further help will be  especially required on this if we are to continue to move at ' internet speed ' .  regards  ben",0

placed sources in the government , the company has informed the  madhav godbole panel that it would be meeting on may 11 . earlier reports had  indicated that the discussions with the panel would take place on may 5 .  according to sources , enron would be meeting the panel with representatives  of its lenders and shareholders . the godbole committee , that studied the  current power purchase agreement , has called for cancellation of the present  tariff structure , renegotiation of the lng and shipping contract , removal of  dollar denomination as far as fixed charges of the tariff is concerned , debt  restructuring and the formation of a committee to renegotiate the power  purchase agreement . these suggestions , it seems , may not be acceptable to  enron . the maharashtra government accepted the report and asked the godbole  committee to renegotiate . the committee has been given a month  , s time to  renegotiate on behalf of the state government with dpc for a new ppa .  the committee has opined that since the lng facility of 5 mmpta is far in  excess of what is required by the plant ( only 2 . 1 mmpta of which 1 . 8 mmpta is  on take or pay ) , it should be separated into a distinct facility whose  capital costs should not be reflected in the fuel charge , not as take or pay .  it should instead be only in proportion to the fuel regassified for the power  generation . using the entire allocated gas requires an unusually high plf .  instead , the surplus gas can be sold to other players like petronet or enron  ,  s own metgas .  & it is important to distribute the cost over the entire  capacity and not just the amount sold to the power plant ,  8 says the  committee . similarly , it has been suggested that enron could lease out the  harbour facilities as a common facility to other lng importers . on the lng  contract negotiated by enron for long - term supplies , it has said that since  the lng market has witnessed great changes , particularly as far as prices are  concerned , the power company should take advantage of spot buys and  renegotiate the contract accordingly .  -

member godbole  panel . though the dpc spokesperson was reluctant to give a confirmation , a key  mantralaya official told the times of india that the team had expressed  willingness for talks with the experts committee in a bid to end the  imbroglio .  enron ' s response is viewed as a welcome development to amicably resolve the  controversy which had been raging for the last few weeks , with the board of  directors of enron authorising its india md k wade cline to serve a  termination notice to mseb . the state government , on its part , too adopted a  confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for  defaulting on power supply . however , the sudden change of heart by the enron  management is largely attributed to the stand taken by its local lenders led  by industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) which had recently opposed the  move to pull out of the project . this was in contradiction to the stand taken  by the foreign lenders of the dpc who were in favour of slamming the brakes  on disbursement of funds to dpc . the congress - led democratic front government  had publicly declared that it would impress upon the enron management to  renegotiate the ppa as scrapping the project would not be in the interest of  both the parties .  last week , the state government constituted a nine - member panel of experts  under former bureaucrat madhav godbole . godbole had written to the dpc  management inviting it for talks to re - negotiate the ppa on may 5 . for the  delayed response from enron , the meeting has been rescheduled to may 11 . the  issues which would be debated at the meeting include the separation of the  lng facility from the power plant , renegotiating lng supply and shipping  agreements , redefining the dpc tariff and to convert it into a two - part  tariff . the godbole panel will bargain hard for removal of dollar  denomination in the fixed charge component and to allow the maharashtra  government to sell power to third parties .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  the financial express , friday , may 04 , 2001 ,  dpc team to appear before godbole panel on may 11  a battery of dabhol power company ( dpc ) officials and foreign lenders will  appear before the madhav godbole renegotiations committee on may 11  & as a  matter of courtesy , and not for presenting any proposals .  8 simultaneously , the  dpc has made it clear that the published terms of the godbole report do not  represent an acceptable basis for further discussions . the dpc team is likely  to include officials from the enron corp , bechtel , general electric , its  liquefied natural gas suppliers , oman lng and abu dhabi lng and a trustee  bank , abn amro for the proposed may 11 meeting , it is reliably learnt .  mantralaya sources said that the dpc had earlier expressed its inability to  appear before the godbole committee on may 5 , fixed earlier , on account of  the non - arrival of its team from houston and other parts of the world .  however , the company has ultimately decided to meet the godbole committee on  may 11 .  dpc spokesman jimmy mogal said :  & we confirm that dpc has been invited to meet  the recently formed negotiating committee . as a matter of courtesy , we have  agreed to meet them next week . since the purpose of our meeting is to hear  out the committee and understand their thoughts , we will not present any  proposals .  8  & while we have constantly maintained that we are open to a  dialogue towards resolving issues , this meeting in no manner be construed as  an open offer from dpc to renegotiate the terms of the contract . furthermore ,  the published terms report do not represent an acceptable basis for further  discussions ,  8 he added . sources said enron corp chairman kenneth lay is likely  to meet former chief minister sharad pawar to find an acceptable solution  for the ongoing crisis before the may 11 meet . mr lay told the foreign news  agency on wednesday that the enron corp has no immediate plans to sell its  stake in the troubled $ 2 . 9 - billion dabhol power project in western india .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  afternoon , may 4 , 2001  houston team to meet godbole  the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) yesterday said it had agreed to  meet the godbole committee "" as a matter of courtesy "" and this should "" in no  manner be construed as an open offer from dpc to renegotiate the terms of the  contract . "" in a statement issued last night , the us energy major made it  clear that the purpose of the meeting with the nine member renegotiating  committee was "" to hear out the panel and understand their thoughts , and not  present any proposals . ""  furthermore , the published terms of the godbole report did not represent any  acceptable basis for towards resolving issues .  earlier , state government sources said that a team of senior officials from  enron headquarters in houston is slated to attend the first godbole  renegotiations committee meeting , now to be held on may 11 . the panel  deferred its meeting from may 5 as in a formal communication , dpc requested  the state government for a suitable date other than the stipulated one , they  said . however , the multinational is yet to send a list of its nominees , who  are due to arrive next week , they said .  meanwhile , the centre is likely to appoint solicitor general harish salve as  its representative on the high - power committee to renegotiate the power  purchase agreement ( ppa ) signed between dpc and maharashtra state electricity  board . other members of the godbole committee are hdfc chairman deepak  parekh , teri director r . k . pachauri , former union energy secretary e . a . s .  sarma , kirit parikh of indira gandhi institute of developmental research ,  maharashtra energy secretary v . m . lal , state finance secretary s . k . srivastav  and mseb chairman vinay bansal .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  business standard , friday , may 04 , 2001  salve may represent centre on enron talks panel  solicitor general harish salve is likely to be named the centre  , s  representative on the high - power committee appointed by the maharashtra  government to renegotiate the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the us  energy giant enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) . according to highly  placed government sources , salve  , s name has been cleared by both ministries  of finance and power .  the maharashtra government has appointed a negotiating committee headed by  former bureaucrat madhav godbole to renegotiate the estranged ppa signed by  the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) and dpc . enron had made  opening of talks with maharashtra conditional on the presence of a centre  , s  representative on the negotiating committee . salve would meet secretaries in  the ministries of finance , power and law to firm up the centre  , s stand on the  crisis arising out of payment defaults by mseb , sources said adding that  petroleum secretary is also likely to be included in the panel .  sources said enron appeared to be keen on solving the present impasse through  negotiations judging from corporation chairman kenneth lay  , s statement  yesterday in houston that the company had no plans to sell its stake in the  $ 2 . 9 billion dabhol project . the government is likely to make a formal  announcement of salve  , s appointment on the negotiating committee by the  weekend , sources said . the negotiating committee would suggest solutions to  bring down the exorbitant power tariffs , separating of the liquefied natural  gas ( lng ) facility , restructuring of dpc and allowing sale of excess power  through central utilities , mainly the national thermal power corporation  ( ntpc ) , sources said . the dpc board had late last month authorised the local  manager in india to issue termination notice to mseb following a bitter  payment controversy . dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the  centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment  of dues .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  the times of india , friday , may 04 , 2001  salve may represent centre on enron talk panel  solicitor general harish salve is likely to be named the centre ' s  representative on the high - power committee appointed by the maharashtra  government to renegotiate the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with us energy  giant enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) . according to highly placed  government sources , salve ' s name had been cleared by both ministries of  finance and power . the maharashtra government has appointed a negotiating  committee headed by former bureaucrat madhav godbole to renegotiate the  estranged ppa signed by maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) and dpc .  enron had made opening of talks with maharashtra conditional on the presence  of centre ' s representative on the negotiating committee . salve would meet  secretaries in the ministries of finance , power and law to firm up centre ' s  stand on the crisis arising out of payment defaults by mseb , sources said ,  adding petroleum secretary is also likely to be included in the panel .  sources said that enron appeared to be keen on solving the present impasse  through negotiations judging from corporation chairman kenneth lay ' s  statement on wednesday in houston that the company had no plans to sell its  stake in the $ 2 . 9 billion dabhol project .

"Subject: from david wood london ( citibank )  letter from david wood ( london )  greetings ,  i am david wood the bank manager of citibank 332 oxford street , london wln  9 aa . i have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you . on  june 6 , 1997 , an iraqi foreign oil consultant / contractor with the british  petroluem corporation mr . haffez al sadique .  made a numbered time ( fixed deposit ) for 36 calendar months , valued at us $ 20 , 500 , 000 . 00  ( twenty nine million five hundred thousand dollars only ) in my branch . upon  maturity in 2000 , i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address  but got no reply .  after a month , we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract  employers , the british petroleum corporation that mr . haffez al sadique  died as a result of torture in the hand of sadam hussein during one of his  trips to his country iraq . on further investigation ,  i found out that he died without making a will , and all attempts to trace  his next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made further investigation and  discovered that mr haffez al sadique . did not declare any kin or relations  in all his official documents , including his bank deposit paperwork in my  bank .  this sum of us $ 29 , 500 , 000 . 00 have been floating as unclaimed since 2000  in my bank as all efforts to get his relatives have hit the stones .  according to the british law at the expiration of 8 ( eight ) years , the money  will revert to the ownership of the british government if nobody applies  to claim the fund and the eight years is the end of december 2004 .  consequently , my proposal is that i want to seek your consent as a foreigner  to stand in as the owner of the money as the next of kin to the deceased  so that the bank will transfer the money to your designated account . all  documents and proves to enable you get this fund will be carefully worked  out . i have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any  of the deceased beneficiaries , and more so i are assuring you that the business  is risk free involvement . your share stays while the rest be for me and  for investment purpose as i will leave london by the end of the year .  the sharing of the funds will be based according to agreement within me  and you . as soon as i receive an acknowledgement of receipt of this message  in acceptance of our mutual business proposal , i will furnish you with the  necessary modalities and disbursement ratio to suit both parties without  any conflict . if this proposal is acceptable by you , do not take undue advantage  of the trust i have bestowed in you .  please , appreciate the fact that doing business over the internet is risk .  endeavor to send your confidential telephone and fax number in your reply  to this business .  god bless you .  mr david wood",1

"Subject: fw : london work  hi ,  how are you ? london seems to be the same as when i left in august - no sun ,  cold , serious looking people , expensive , etc . in addition , we have had may  day riots , a post office bombing , train strike , etc . not to mention all the  excitement in enron credit .  it would be nice to know who i am supposed to be reporting to . i am getting  loads of conflicting messages - as illustrated in the forwarded email from  vasant . according to you and slava , the strategy paper / duffie report seems  to be a higher priority . however , vasant seems to indicate ( in his forwarded  email ) that this is not the priority at the moment .  in addition , there seems to be lots of chaos in enron credit - not only in  the houston office , but even more so in the london office . this brings to  mind a russian proverb i learned from slava when he expressed his views on  the current state of enron credit - "" a fish rots from the head .

"Subject: comments  hi sheridan ,  how are you ? i hope that you had a good vacation . vasant and i looked at  your memo and found it to be interesting . i shall first briefly summarize  our understanding of the methodology you propose . the comments follow .  finally , i shall sketch a simple gas field project you can use as a test case  in further refining the model .  it appears that you are proposing a state - space approach where probabilities  of different states at various future dates are specified . the next step is  to assume a discount rate and to compute the present value by following the  branches from the origin to one of the terminal points . traversing through  the tree in this manner over many iterations will permit us to compute the  average present value of the project . also , you are using the simulation to  assign a value of the project to each node . thus each node will have a cash  flow associated with it which will occur if the node is reached and a value  which is an expectation of the value to be realized going forward . if some  of these values turn out to be negative , zero - coupon , risk - free bonds are  purchased to neutralize the negative realization .  next , we find a comparable and apply the expected rate of return back to our  project ( based on the variance of the returns ) . we iterate until  convergence .  finally , we subtract the initial investment and the computed risk capital  from the pv of the gross cash flows ( including debt ) to determine if the  project merits further consideration .  comments / clarifications  1 . the money is being set aside to avoid negative values . it is not clear  if you mean the values of the cash flow or the pv at the node . anyhow , we  shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes at  that cross - section of time as the risk - free asset pays in all states of  nature . this will have to be done every time there is a negative  realization . thus , for the typical project we have , the value of risk  capital may be extremely high , as we are not following a tail - based norm  anymore .  2 . your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all  values being positive . if so , we are only issuing risk - free debt . also , a  project with a single negative value at each cross - section of time will not  have a positive debt capacity .  3 . it seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate , which is  obtained in each step from the comparison investment ( by equating the  variances ) . it is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such an  effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence . also ,  our project has a finite life and the market - based assets will have infinite  lives . in the light of this fact , how will we define the relevant variance ?  is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison investment ?  4 . finally , our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the investment  and also the risk capital . setting risk capital to zero , this model closely  resembles the intuitive present value criterion and endogenously determines  the discount rate .  gas field case  to facilitate your thinking , we are providing a gas field example below .  we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field . a profile of  expected production and variance of the production per year is available from  the engineers at the beginning . production will be autocorrelated , as the  profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being more or  less than the estimated reserves . we assume the life of the field to be 10  years with no salvage value . there are fixed and variable operating costs .  it might be useful for you to think about applying the framework to this  problem .  do let me know if you have further questions .  rakesh",0
