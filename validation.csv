"Subject: uk rpi model  hi zimin !  please find attached for your review the uk rpi model , derived by  bootstrapping rpi swaps .  it ' s a very simple model and here are its specifics :  swap structure  payment : semi / semi act / 365 f  >  > yoyukrpi = ( ukrpi ( p - 2 ) / ukrpi ( p - 14 ) - 1 ) / 2  > p = payment month  >  the first payment is the latest known historical rpi , february 2000 , 2 . 32 % .  assumptions  * constant cashflows between the quoted years ( as opposed to interpolating  swaps which distorts the curve a lot ) . this explains the atrocious look of  the "" raw "" curve . it is then smoothed with a macro , which anjam wrote .  * mid point of the swaps is used for deriving the curve ;  * discount rate is libor and i solve for the coupon rate , which is the rpi  yoy rate ;  * the above is solved separately for each quoted period ( e . g . 2 yrs , 5 yrs )  and rpi rates are determined for the incremental portion .  by forecasting rpi in the above method we are able to lock in and deliver the  forecasted levels .  looking forward to your comments and seeing you in london !  best regards ,  martina  x 34327",0

"Subject: urgent reply .  from the desk of : barr arisman shonikon  chambers & associates  no 56 b . aba road , port - harcourt nigeria  private email address ( @ shymail . com )  dear  i sincerely apologize for intruding into your privacy especially by  contacting you through this means for a business transaction of this  magnitude , but due to its seriousness and urgency it therefore became  necessary for me to seek your assistance .  i am barr . arisman shonikon , the personal lawyer to late mr . frank ionescu , a  foreigner , who worked with an oil servicing company in the oil rich niger  delta area of bayelsa state . i am contacting you concerning my late client  and an investment he made . i would respectfully request that you keep the  contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the  information you come by as a result of this mail . i contacted you  independently and no one should be informed of this communication . i would  like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest  to you .  this is a genuine transaction and is 100 % risk free . all i ' m demanding from  you is your honest co - operation to enable us achieve our goal , and not a  perfidious person . on the 6 th of may , 2002 it was reported to us that my  client , his wife and their only daughter were involved in a local plane  crash at kano state , enroot abuja ( the capital city ) all occupants in the  plane lost their lives , unfortunately on this same flight were other  dignitaries like the sports minister and a host of others  meanwhile , until his death , my late client had a fixed deposit account of  usd $ 15 . million deposited in a security company ( unic security company )  here . recently , i received an ultimatum from the security company asking me  to provide my late client ' s relative so that the money would be given to  them . but unfortunately it was discovered that my late client did not  declare any identifiable family member in all the official documents he  tendered to the security company while opening the account .  therefore , this development leaves me as the only person with the full  picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit my  late client made and who is entitled to be the bona fide beneficiary / next of  kin or relative because he died intestate . therefore , if i fail to locate  any of his relatives or his next of kin ( and have this money transferred to  them ) the security company will at the expiration of the 6 weeks ultimatum  given to me confiscate the account .  according to the ultimatum issued to me by the security company , if i fail  to present to them my late client ' s relative , with a legitimate statement of  claim for the money before the given time they will confiscate the account  and the money declared ' unclaimed balance ' . this will result in the money  being taken over by the security company . this will not happen if i have my  way .  since i have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives of my late client  all these while , my proposal , therefore , is to present you as the next of  kin / relative of my client due to the fact that you are a foreigner and can  easily pass as a possible relative of my client . i know you will be  wondering how possible this could be but i assure you that this is simple .  i therefore seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to my client  so that the money he deposited with the security company would be paid to  you and there after you and i will share the money 40 % for you and i will be  taking 60 % . i assure you that the deposit would be released to you within a  few days because i have all the relevant information that would facilitate  that will be required on documentation .  first , i will like you to provide immediately the following information :  your full names .  contact address .  telephone / fax numbers .  with this information i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavit  that will put you in place as the next of kin . after we have successfully  satisfied the requirements of the bank the money totaling usd 15 . million  would be paid into your account for you to take 40 % and i will be taking  60 % . all i require is your honest co - operation to enable us see this  through .  there is no risk at all because everything would be done legally and my  position as a qualified attorney will facilitate everything . secondly , i  will give you all the necessary documents that would serve as evidence  proving that you are the next of kin / relative of my late client . these  documents will legally conferm on you the status to act as the beneficiary  of the estate of my late client .  what i related to you might smack of unethical practice but i want you to  understand that this is a once in life time opportunity capable of turning  around our situation . the truth is that this money would not be taken by the  government but by some greedy security company officials and i would not  fold my arms and watch this happen hence my decision to contact you .  if you are interested in doing this transaction with me kindly send your  reply to this email address : ( arismanshonikon @ shymail . com )  thank you as i await your positive response .  barr . arisman shonikon .",1

"Subject: enron europe organisational changes  once the arcos plant in spain is financially closed ( expected in q 2 of this  year ) eric gonzales will be moving back to houston to work exclusively on  co - managing enron ' s lng markets . we are very appreciative of eric ' s efforts  in europe since early 1998 and look forward to continuing to work very  closely with his lng team in the coming years . from this point forward eric  will focus his remaining time in europe exclusively on financially closing  arcos .  we are therefore making the following changes immediately . the origination  responsibility for italy will be moved under eric shaw . ricardo bortolloti  will continue in the role as italian country manager and will report to eric  shaw . mariano gentilini will become our country manager for spain and  portugal and will report directly to the enron europe office of the chairman .  the arcos power project is likely to create a large gas to power spread  position and so we have asked paul mead to assume the added responsibility  for our natural gas risk positions in spain . this position is much more  likely to be supplied and influenced by lng rather than continental gas  markets and paul will work quite closely with both enron global markets and  the continental gas team .  ross sankey who has been managing our marketing efforts in holland will also  head a new organization that will focus on subsea interconnector and power  transmission opportunities across europe . among the prospects his team will  pursue include projects from norway to the uk , sweden to the continent ,  and bidding on existing french interconnector capacity . he will report to  eric shaw for the holland markets and to richard lewis for the transmission  responsibilities .  finally the continental gas team is interacting far more with our uk gas team  than our power teams on the continent . therefore david galagher who manages  our continental gas team will now report directly to richard lewis .  we have aggressive income targets for this year and anticipate that these  changes will create the right links to optimize our performance . please help  make these changes as smooth as possible .  john sherriff  michael brown",0

"" so many times that  sensible people have learned to discount such claims .  but now a bona fide wolf has arrived , whose predatory behavior is  doing terrible damage to our most populous state  * and nobody will  believe it .  true , california would be heading for a summer of power shortages  even if it had never deregulated . and even if there was workable  competition in the wholesale electricity market , prices in that  market would spike during periods of peak demand , transferring  billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the  generators .  but the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn ' t workable  competition in california ' s power market , and that the actions of  generators "" gaming the system "" have greatly magnified the crisis .  the key fact is that california has somehow remained in a state of  more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale  prices regardless of the level of demand . a rash of outages has  kept the electricity market conveniently  * and very profitably  *  short of supply even during periods of low demand , when there ought  to be lots of excess capacity .  as frank wolak , the stanford economist who also advises the  state ' s power grid , has pointed out , an outage at a power plant is  a lot like an employee calling in sick . you can ' t tell directly  whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for  other reasons , but you can look for circumstantial evidence . and  such evidence has convinced mr . wolak that "" generators use forced  outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market ""  * a  view shared by a growing number of other researchers .  which brings us to the latest move by the federal energy  regulatory commission . on wednesday , the commission apparently  decided to offer california some relief , and put new price caps in  place on the california electricity market . i say "" apparently ""  because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to  be any help at all . indeed , the measure was passed on a 2 - to - 1  vote , with william massey  * the one commissioner who has been  sympathetic to calls for price controls  * voting against it on the  grounds that it would be ineffectual .  what ' s wrong with ferc ' s plan ? first , it caps prices only in  emergency conditions  * ignoring the fact that electricity prices  have stayed at hard - to - explain levels even when there is no  emergency . in effect , the plan is laid out as if the electricity  market were really competitive , in spite of all the evidence that  it is not .  second , even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes ,  offering extensive opportunities for what mr . wolak calls "" megawatt  laundering ""  * selling power to affiliated companies that for one  reason or another are exempted from the price controls ( for  example , the controls do not apply to "" imports "" from neighboring  states ) , then selling it back into the california market . severin  borenstein of the university of california energy institute adds  that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at  the least efficient plant , generators will have a clear incentive  to produce inefficiently : "" i predict we will find some plants we  never heard of before that are suddenly operating again , and they  will be pretty inefficient . ""  the general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan .  there are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there  *  indeed , last fall mr . wolak submitted a proposal that was well  received by other experts  * but ferc has ignored all of them .  the charitable interpretation is that ferc still doesn ' t get it ,  that it just can ' t bring itself to believe that this time the wolf  is real . the uncharitable interpretation is that last week ' s action  was meant to fail . the medley report , an online newsletter , calls  the ferc plan "" a grand exercise in posturing without substance . .  . a very clever temporary move by the bush administration to  deflect any political fallout "" from the looming disaster .  whatever the explanation , the plain fact is that ferc and the  administration have yet to offer california any significant  relief .  00 fo 04 b 3 blabf  visit nytimes . com for complete access to the  most authoritative news coverage on the web ,  updated throughout the day .  become a member today ! it ' s free !  http : / / www . nytimes . com ? eta  how to advertise  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  for information on advertising in e - mail newsletters  or other creative advertising opportunities with the  new york times on the web , please contact alyson  racer at alyson @ nytimes . com or visit our online media  kit at http : / / www . nytimes . com / adinfo  for general information about nytimes . com , write to  help @ nytimes . com .  copyright 2001 the new york times company",0

term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities ( including deferred taxes , investment tax credit , and minority interest ) .  retained earnings  retained earnings , a historical measure of performance , is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders . typically , it is the prior year ' s retained earnings plus net income less distributions . retained earnings are generally positive . some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings . leave this field blank for australian companies .  sales  this item consists of the industry segment ' s gross sales ( the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period ) reduced by cash discounts , trade discounts , and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers .  cost of goods sold  entered in thousands of dollars , this value is generally a positive number less than sales . it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production , such as material , labor , and overhead . not fixed overhead or items that would be included in selling , general , and administrative expenses . leave this field blank for australian companies .  ebit  earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation . it can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income .  interest expense  this item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short -

"Subject: power trading  hi folks :  very glad to hear about the new developments . just to recap what we  discussed this morning about different things you need to look into to set up  trading operations and the contacts :  1 . licence to trade : regulatory people : i guess you know about this part  better than me .  2 . trading & risk mgmt : global risk mgmt oversight : john sherrif in london  has the overall responsibility outside western hemisphere . research group can  help with the structuring models used for trading .  3 . risk conrols : before trading group is operational , it needs to get the  authorization from the board of directors of enron along with total position  limits and possibly value @ risk limits . these limits are typically by  commodity type and by region . risk assessment & control ( rac ) under rick buy  performs the internal control function ensuring that the businesses adhere to  these trading limits . ted murphy is the vp in rac overseeing the trading  operations . the value @ risk models come from the research group , but  day - to - day monitoring of the numbers is done by ted ' s group .  4 . credit risk : a credit reserve number is computed for each deal ( again , the  models are created by research ) and is transferred to the credit group under  bill bradford ( also in rac ) . this is basically like buying insurance from the  corp . , so that if there is a couterparty default , the loss is covered by the  reserve pool of the credit dept .  5 . legal : the name i was given is alan aronowitz for legal help .  6 . back office : initially can survive with excel spreadsheets . you should  contact the it though when the plans finalize to talk about systems .  australia is the most recent place where we set up the trading operations .  you can talk to paul quilky , the trader there to talk about these issues  ( mention to him that grant masson in research gave his name ) .  barry pierce in london was incharge of back office at the begin there .  i can coordinate for talking with people next week . give me a call monday if  possible . i hadn ' t the time to search for the presentation stuff today . will  do it next week .  krishna .",0
"Subject: gas & power marketing & trading study  vincent ,  i enjoyed meeting with you yesterday and discussing our gas & power  marketing & trading study . we really hope that enron is able to participate  this year and we will work with you to address your concerns . i believe  that the problem last year was primarily due to concerns over releasing data  in general and not our study in particular .  i am attaching an electronic copy of the latest version of the input sheet  for the study . it is far easier to read on a computer than in print .  please remember that enron does not need to answer every question to  participate and that all results are reported back in a blinded format . the  only data points identified by company are the data points for the company  values of the company receiving the report .  if you have any further questions regarding the report , please do not  hesitate to call john stephenson or myself at ( 713 ) 523 - 8001 . have a great  weekend and thank you for your efforts to enable enron to participate in  this year ' s study .  sincerely ,  richard murphy  rmurphy @ navigantconsulting . com  ( 713 ) 523 - 8001  - 2000 input sheet . xls",0

"Subject: california update 1 / 31 / 01  please do not hesitate to contact robert johnston ( x 39934 ) or kristin walsh  ( x 39510 ) with additional questions .  executive summary  an announcement could be made as early as today regarding the first wave of  long - term contracts ( price and term ) .  the threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing as davis hatches a plan  to 1 ) pass on "" court ordered rate increases "" and 2 ) issue revenue bonds .  audit results are in and questions loom about the amount of funds transferred  to parent companies . davis is expected to use the threat of "" endless  appeals "" in courts and a possible ballot initiative in november to keep the  pressure on the parent companies to pay a share of the utility debt , as well  as to limit the scope of the rate hikes .  davis hopes that a court ruling in favor of the utilities would provide him  with the political cover he needs to pass on rate hikes to california  consumers and avoid utility bankruptcy .  davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy groups . if there is a  ballot initiative in november to challenge the expected court - ordered rate  hikes , it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state .  legislation and bail out  bill ablx was heard for several hours in the senate appropriations  yesterday . issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure ,  specifically for communities that have harsh climates . however , the bill has  received support from almost everyone including consumer groups . the bill  is expected to pass sometime today . tim gage , ca director of finance said  davis supports all the provisions in ablx and expected to sign .  bill abl 8 x was not heard in the assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear  today . in committee hearings monday , the dwr testified it is spent all of  the $ 400 m and were spending $ 45 m / day in the spot market to buy power .  according to sources with direct access to governor davis , the on - going court  battle , as discussed below , is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a  settlement . davis recognizes that 1 ) the expected court ruling in the cpuc  case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to  california rate payers ; 2 ) despite that ruling , the state government has the  ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the  two utilities unless they come to terms . thus , davis believes that  california consumers cannot avoid getting hit with higher electricity  charges , but he plans to use the threat of an appeal ( and a possible ballot  initiative ) to limit the amount of the rate hikes .  a plan to exempt the lowest income , smallest consumers from any rate increase  and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using 130 % of a baseline  usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in sacramento . that would  still hit about one half of all consumers ( since the "" baseline "" is set at 60 %  of average consumption ) , but it is "" progressive "" in a politically important  sense .  making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night  when pg & e admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many  customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates .  the company ' s defense ( they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash ) was  met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation  policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious  efforts by californians to use less electricity . "" every time you think  there ' s a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves ,  something like this happens , "" one legislator moaned .  long - term contracts  a second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the  negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of long - term power buying  contracts davis initiated earlier this month . the first wave of those  contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be  surprisingly positive , according to officials in the talks . "" we got a series  of good offers in those initial proposals . and some not so good ones , "" one  official told our source . "" the idea is to announce the results of the first  contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say ,  ' you want in on this with these terms ? ' we think we ' ll eventually shake  loose a lot of supply with this strategy . ""  bankruptcy  because of these new dynamics , there is improved market confidence that  california will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for  socal edison and pg & e , even as they are set to miss another round of payments  to creditors and suppliers today ( remember , there is a standstill agreement  among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until feb . 13 ) .  we believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost  by the court case in front of us district judge ronald s . w . lew in los  angeles , which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for  elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week , at  the latest . in fact , without that political cover it would be impossible to  square all the various circles of this crisis .  audit results and ballot initiatives  markets , bush administration officials , and perhaps utility companies  themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will  launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of 200 l to bring all  electricity generation back under state control . the threat of a proposition  initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the  california public utilities commission released in the last 48 hours  confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since  mid - january . first , the audit of socal edison confirmed that $ 2 billion of  the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to  itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells  power . second , it confirmed that edison electric paid nearly $ 5 billion in  profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its  stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even  while it was going on a debt - issuing binge .  the audit of pg & e released late last night was even more damaging : pg & e  management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to  "" clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis "" by not making deep  spending cuts , "" including scaling back management salaries . "" the auditors  also questioned the utility ' s decision to funnel some $ 4 . 7 billion of its  profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company ,  which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks .  "" basically , they took the money and ran , "" as state senate speaker burton put  it yesterday .  what appears to be governor gray davis ' grudging acceptance of reality is  actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough  rate hikes / taxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without  triggering a new - - and far more damaging - - burst of populist outrage among  a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making  this all up . there is no doubt that this use of money by socal edison and  the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the  spirit of the 1996 deregulation law , but that is irrelevant in popular  political terms . were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by  the court case discussed below , these audits would make settlement extremely  difficult .  keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key  to understanding the very complex game that davis , his advisers and senior  legislators are now playing . a ballot initiative would be a potential  disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at re - establishing full  public control over the electric utilities . even if the state and utilities  successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before  that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during  that prolonged period . that ' s something california cannot afford as  businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate .  court battle  thus , legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of  the court case in los angeles that socal edison and pg & e are likely to win in  mid - february . the court will most likely grant the two utilities $ 12 . 7  billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders  of consumers who would see bills rise by at least 30 % , california politicians  could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start  of this extended drama : political cover . davis will then have to rely on his  political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the  utilities to pass on something less than the full $ 12 . 7 billion debt .  pg & e and socal edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed  to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they  have accumulated since august last year when the puc refused to let them  raise prices even as electricity prices soared . the court said the 1996  deregulation law was crystal clear - - when the two utilities had repaid  so - called "" stranded costs , "" they were free to begin charging whatever they  needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power .  although the utilities won this case , the judge stayed his order until  february 14 th at the state government ' s request . as that deadline  approaches , an intense new negotiating round is under way . on the one hand ,  political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher  electric prices ( "" the courts made me do it "" ) , but on the other hand , they  also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would  force electricity rates up by about 40 % on top of natural gas bills that have  soared by about 300 % since last year . utility companies are playing this  card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final  bailout . "" we ' ll just wait until the court puts the order into effect in  mid - february then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and  easily . ""  one tactic the state political officials are using , in order to force a  settlement , is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the  next couple of years . one political official pointed out that they could  keep the utilities from receiving their money this year , next year or perhaps  even the year after . "" sure , we tell them , they will probably win in court and  get that money . eventually . we are making them well aware that unless we  have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the supreme  court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least . we don ' t think  the creditors will be quite that patient .

"Subject: re : pricing credit on thousands of names  we can continue the discussion in tuesday ' s conference call , but i discussed  with ben about the issues below , and here are some thoughts . this is not a  complete approach , but only a starting point for discussion .  the main task is to build a pricing system for many names .  this has two components - - -  1 ) how to price a single name ?  1 . 1 ) how to price a liquid single name ?  1 . 2 ) how to price an illiquid single name ?  2 ) how to efficiently apply the methodology to multiple names ?  the approach i would take for 1 . 1 is  a ) define a small set of liquid names  b ) apply each of the different models we have , say , the six models ben has  mentioned below , to these names  c ) include market prices , if any , for these names  d ) sit with traders , get trader ' s intuition on where each liquid name should  price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in ( b ) and ( c )  e ) try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion  of the trader prices across the models  f ) quantify these attributes , if possible  g ) try a different set of liquid names and repeat the process , and see if the  decisions in the last round still make sense  the approach for 1 . 2 may be  a ) define a small set of illiquid names  b ) apply each of the different models we have to these names  c ) sit with traders , get trader ' s intuition on where each illiquid name  should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in ( b )  d ) try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion  of the trader prices across the models  e ) check if these are similar to the attributes identified for liquid names  f ) define a master set of liquid names  g ) look for relationships ( by analyzing cross - section of data ) between  attributes or prices of illiquid names to those of liquid names  once a mapping has been defined for an illiquid name to a set of liquid names  and their attributes , then this mapping can be entered into a table , and the  pricing can be automated for all names ( in theory ) ! the success will depend  on the success of the round - table sessions for the approaches for 1 . 1 and  1 . 2 .  building a new fundamental model is always a worthwhile task , but we can get  going with the above approaches immediately in parallel with developing any  new models that we may build . new models can be added to the suite of  existing models . i do not believe there will ever be a single model that will  answer all questions for all names , but rather we can refine the mappings and  relative choices among models over time , which would mean continuing  round - table sessions with traders . limited data makes calibration very hard ,  so i would continually ask the question "" what do we calibrate ? "" throughout  the discussions for 1 . 1 and 1 . 2 , and this may help guide us to new models .  vasant  benjamin parsons  06 / 19 / 2000 04 : 11 am  to : ect london credit trading  cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect , amitava  dhar / corp / enron @ enron , steven leppard / lon / ect @ ect , grant masson / hou / ect @ ect ,  dale surbey / lon / ect @ ect , david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect , jitendra j  patel / lon / ect @ ect , oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect  subject : pricing credit on thousands of names  all -  our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to  provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [ 5 , 000 by year - end ] .  most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information ,  making the challenge harder , and the end result more important in terms of  competitive pricing advantage . what we need is an overall strategy for how we  plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective .  currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under  development :  fmc model ( default probability approach ) . using bloomberg ' s fair market ( par  yield ) curves , probabilities are generated from the risky - libor , then  default / bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology .  fmc model ( credit spread approach ) . using the fmcs , then directly taking the  libor credit spread at each tenor , adjusting for basis and compounding  differences .  bond model ( fmc approach ) . taking the fmcs as benchmark curves , the model  regresses the input bonds ( specific to a name ) on the two best fitting  benchmarks . the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs ,  but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer . prices are then generated  using both spread and probability approaches . under testing .  bond model ( spline approach ) . taking only the bonds specific to an issuer ,  the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero - coupon price curve ,  then builds a zero yield curve from this . under testing .  market prices . for certain liquid names , or sectors / ratings , cds market  prices are used , then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap  prices .  kmv . using expected default frequencies ( edfs ) from the kmv model and  database , we will build a model to price default swaps , making appropriate  risk adjustments . kmv is being installed now , so model will be worked on next .  each of these models returns a price ( credit default and bankruptcy ) , and the  accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory  differences between bond and cds markets , recovery assumptions , risk premia ,  capital charges , etc . the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid  names as possible , based upon these models , then use these prices , alongside  other financial information , as the backbone to a full automated pricing  system .  our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and  market prices for all issuers , alongside name - specific ' soft ' data from  credit reports and financial statements . if the credit is liquid enough , a  price will be generated from their own information only . otherwise , the  credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits , with financial  information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights .  the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with  market ( or trader ) prices , and this adjustment will feed back into the  weighting and mapping composition . in loose terms , we could think of the  system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid  market prices ( bonds , equities , default swaps ) , where the weightings are  calibrated using credit analysis , financial ratios , etc .  the key steps to implementing such a system will be :  establishing what exactly we want to ' predict ' - is it a price , a rating , a  probability , or a score ? we will need a clean market history to calibrate to ,  which we only really have for ratings . we will then need to develop a mapping  from rating / score to price .  getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to  calibrate the model .  building the mechanics of the model , ie , the calibration methodology . neural  nets / fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates , but which exact methods and  software packages to use ?  determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited  information into the model .  getting the "" true "" market price , in order to feed back an error . at present  such a price exists for very few credits .  allocating resources to the development . mckinsey claimed such a system would  take 6 - 10 man - months to develop .  further ideas or comments are requested , as we need to develop our strategy  asap . the model description above is fairly vague , as we don ' t yet have the  knowledge needed to fill in the specific details . further help will be  especially required on this if we are to continue to move at ' internet speed ' .  regards  ben",0

"Subject: re : corn subsidy govt program analysis  vasant ,  thanks . let ' s contact wharton next week .  vince  from : vasant shanbhogue / enron @ enronxgate on 04 / 25 / 2001 10 : 15 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc : nelson neale / na / enron @ enron  subject : corn subsidy govt program analysis  hi vince ,  nelson and i had a meeting yesterday with the ag desk folks on how to go  forward on the analysis and presentation for this program . the consensus  from the ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically  driven , ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close  ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures . also it is  preferable if the university faculty have worked on ag issues before , lending  more credibility in the ag community . the names that came up were  mississippi state and texas a & m . nelson knows of a person at mississippi  state who worked with the usda on risk management issues .  the needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep , and the focus is  primarily to get a non - quantitative presentation out that outlines how enron  can take on the downside risk of local crop prices ( enron probably needs to  cover actual local prices and not simply an index because i do not think the  govt will want to worry about basis risk ) .  the pilot program itself will be very small , and lends itself to continuing  down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination .  another thought on hedging our potential short positon ( on the origination  side ) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent  of the premium received - - we still have unlimited downside from the short .  vasant  p . s . i am writing up jim bouillion ' s project suggestion as a potential  project for wharton . of course , we may still ask wharton for their insights  on the corn price protection approach .",0

"" this new market standard should put into place the necessary market  improvements more quickly and at a reduced cost than if we were to implement a  customized market system for new england , "" said william w . berry , chairman and  acting ceo of iso new england . "" now is the time to stop the experimentation .  ultimately , we hope the standard market design will serve as the benchmark for  wholesale electricity marketplaces across the country , if not around the  world . ""  "" pjm is very excited to further standardize a design for a competitive  wholesale  electricity market , "" said phillip g . harris , chairman and ceo of pjm . "" along  with the progress in the implementation of the pjm west concept , this  initiative  will provide an even broader standardized market design .

"" we intend to continue to work with the new york iso on issues of mutual  importance , "" stated mr . berry . "" this new market design , together with our  efforts to address the market "" seams "" and other coordination issues , will  eventually bring the three northeast iso markets closer together . "" iso new  england and the new york iso will continue to work together on these issues  under a joint board resolution passed on january 16 , 2001 .

( i will be glad to put  this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move  forward . )  i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of our  approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you  might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you  were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same  time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the  benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a  complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i  would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i  look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as  a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to  earn and secure your business .  if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount  marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest you  begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1  day training seminar .  our clients are usually very fluent after that 1  day training seminar .  thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a  few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable  before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks  later .  thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting that  i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show  anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the  meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted .  dale nesbitt  president  marketpoint inc .  27121 adonna ct .  los altos hills , ca 94022  ( 650 ) 218 - 3069  dale . nesbitt @ marketpointinc . com  - license . doc",0

"Subject: california update 3 / 06 / 01  executive summary  ? if no comprehensive deal is reached by april 9 th , chances of bankruptcy  increase due to a one day "" opt - out "" clause in all long - term power contracts .  ? pg & e and state locked in tough negotiations , several issues on the table :  puc - imposed requirement forcing pg state - 2 . 3 times book value vs . pg & e - 4 times book value  ? pg & e will not use any of the $ 1 b secured last week to help their ailing  utility .  ? davis ' s announcement of long term power contract didn ' t include some  details :  of the 8 , 800 megawatts secured this far , only 6 , 000 are available this  summer  some of the "" long term contracts "" are really only for three months  none of the contracts prevent california from buying peak demand on the spot  market  ? one the same day davis announced long term contracts , davis also quietly  announce a 10 % rate hike .  ? ferc may be the wild card in approving this deal .  pg & e  transmissions deal  one thing that is still uncertain is pg & e . bankruptcy may still be a likely  alternative if current negotiations to buy pg & e ' s share of the electric  transmission grid fail to produce a deal by april 9 ( when all long - term power  contracts being negotiated have a one - day "" opt - out "" clause they can exercise  unilaterally if a "" comprehensive solution "" has not been reached by the state  and its major utilities ) . according to sources close to senior pg & e  officials , pg & e made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal  on the transmission lines depends on the california government ' s willingness  to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make  until now .  pg & e will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless davis agrees to  relieve it of the puc - imposed requirement to be the "" electricity buyer of  last resort . "" current state regulations make the utility companies  ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all  times to supply california ' s energy needs . as long as the state steps in and  makes those purchases , as it has for the past three months , the utilities are  shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot  market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings .  but , pg & e officials are worried 1 ) this summer ' s supply and 2 ) davis ' s  concern over how fast he is draining the state ' s budget surplus . if things  get into a crunch this summer and davis makes a new decision that the state  will pay only for the electricity it buys through long - term contracts , then  pg & e will be left holding the bag .  thus , as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid , pg & e is  demanding a "" comprehensive solution "" that includes not being liable for cost  differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed  to pay . state officials are in no mood to grant that kind of "" get out of  jail free "" card , so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough  negotiations that are complicated by three other factors : ( 1 ) pg ( 2 ) state legislative  demands that the price davis negotiate for pg and ( 3 ) the ferc must  "" positively approve "" any grid purchase by the state of california .  the principal concern on the price front is that pg & e wants to sell the  electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their  transmission , while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the  politically acceptable limit . "" we see 2 . 3 times book value as an absolute  upper bound . there is no way pg & e will get more than that , whatever they  think , "" according to the leader of one main consumer groups . "" we are going  to try to force any deals down to about 2 . 0 in any case . "" negotiators for  davis are also trying to ' proposition - proof ' any transmission deal to protect  against a later ballot proposal . they think there are ways to do that , but  not if the price of pg & e ' s part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative .  remember , if davis ' s eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative , he will  be running for re - election on the same ballot as a public initiative designed  to overturn his solution .  on the sacramento front - no one understands pg & e ' s motives  the one question no one in sacramento can figure out is what kind of game  pg & e is playing . in a three day period pg & e made a series of announcements  that left everyone scratching their heads .  ? late thursday , pg & e officials leaked information to california papers that  they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity  transmission grid to the state , which seemed like obvious good news , but then  made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least 30 %  above what the state was currently offering . while a deal can still be done ,  anything like the $ 10 billion pg & e wants would be very hard to get through  the california legislature which needs to approve any purchase .  ? late friday , pg & e officials announced that they had secured a $ 1 billion  loan for the parent company ( not the electricity utility ) and would use the  money to pay off bondholders , other creditors and to return $ 161 million to  shareholders in a new dividend payout . not a cent of that money was  earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of pg & e and that left at  least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the  utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood .  ? over the weekend , pg & e leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay  off its energy suppliers ' debt for 15 cents on the dollar right now . for  generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to  start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy  action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will  "" make them whole "" in a couple of months , that kind of trial balloon is  extremely unnerving .  thus , in a very short time period , pg & e ' s corporate owners showed they could  access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they  were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the  energy crisis . davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at  least a part of the $ 13 billion debt they have accumulated since last summer  and pg & e ' s fund - raising will harden and deepen those demands . as one senior  political official told our source "" just when you think the corporate  leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible , they  come up with something even more outrageous . ""  pg and some of these "" long - term contracts "" are actually only good  for three months . none of these contracts , however , keep california from  having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market .  davis agrees on new consumer electricity rate hikes for next year  while the media was concern with davis ' s announcement of long term contracts  for california , of less concern to the media was davis ' s quietly announced a  decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers . the state will  accept the 10 % emergency surcharge levied on consumers in january as a  permanent increase as well as an additional 10 % increase for consumers that  will take effect early 2002 when the old 1996 rate cut legislation expires .  that would bring the average charge to about 8 cents a kilowatt hour .  ferc  the other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the federal  energy regulatory commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve  it in a positive vote . senior california officials and legislators doubt that  ferc has jurisdiction , and believe that ferc would not dare stop a deal . but  they may be wrong . "" the deal can only go through if ferc specifically signs  off on the deal . its power over transmission deal is absolute , no matter what  anyone says , "" according to source close to the president . there are three  possibilities : 1 ) ferc could "" pocket veto "" it by not even putting it on  agenda for discussion ; 2 ) the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted  down . the democrat on the commission , william massey , has already said he is  opposed to it ; or 3 ) the commission could approve it but with condition that  davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system .  one complicating factor in the ferc decision , however , is that its chairman  curt hebert , who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale , may not  be around long enough to have his say .

"Subject: enron net works  it is becoming increasingly clear that the development of ecommerce will have  a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad  array of industries . through enrononline , enron has quickly become a major  catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries .  enrononline has been an enormous success since its launch . since launch , we  have completed 67 , 043 transactions on line , with a total dollar value of over  $ 25 billion . enrononline is now the largest ecommerce site in the world .  we believe that the competitive success of enrononline is due to one very  specific reason . in addition to providing a web - based platform for  transactions , enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the  site . we stand ready at all times , in any market conditions , to buy and sell  at the posted price . this converts a  & bulletin board  8 ( the more typical  ecommerce concept ) into a true market . there are very few , if any ,  competitors that can provide this capability .  we are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be  dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies . if we are  correct , this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for enron .  accordingly , we are initiating a major new effort to capture this  opportunity . effective today we are creating a new business , enron net  works , to pursue new market development opportunities in ecommerce across a  broad range of industries . it is likely that this business will ultimately  be our fifth business segment , joining transmission mike  mcconnell , chief operating officer ; and jeff mcmahon , chief commercial  officer . these individuals will comprise the office of the chairman for  enron net works and remain on the executive committee of enron corp .  replacing greg whalley as president and chief operating officer of enron  north america is dave delainey , who will also join enron  , s executive  committee .  global technology will remain intact but will now be a part of enron net  works . it will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as  an enron global function . philippe bibi will remain the chief technology  officer for all of enron corp . and continues to be responsible for the  development of worldwide technology standards and platforms .  enrononline , headed by louise kitchen , will also remain intact and will now  be a part of enron net works . the success of enrononline enables us to  utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets . in addition , the  following individuals are included in enron net works along with their  current ecommerce initiatives : harry arora , public financial securities ; jay  fitzgerald , new markets identification ; bruce garner , metals ; and greg piper ,  pulp and paper .  over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational  design and will provide full details on this exciting new business  opportunity .",0

"Subject: interview - numerical methods & finance  dear tanya :  it was a great pleasure to have met you . i very much enjoyed the interview and your insightfull questions .  i am keenly aware that many of the methods that i discussed with you yesterday are unique , new and not reported elsewhere . this is true both about the work i did in whole yield curve interest rate pricing as well as garch . the innovations stem from the extensive numerical analysis experience that i have both in turbulence physics as well as finance . they entailed considering the problem from its raw formulation , mathematical analysis , physical interpretation , taylored numerical method development , software writting and develoment and data management .  as to why i have not yet published anything the answer is that the driver in my work has been adding value to the business not publishing . publishing is however an option that has always been open with my former supervisor who is aware of the work that i did .  i not however that these results were possible only by exploring to the utmost extent the mathematics , finance , software design and data managemnet aspects of the problem . absence of any of these aspects is likely to cripple performance and execution .  please recall that as good as they were the performance measures that i mentioned to you were for a single processor machine . vastly better can be achieved with both soft parallelism ( multithreading ) as well as hard parallelism ( heterogenous network ) . this fo course allows us to step up the reach of the models used .  in fact i know for a fact that better can be done than what i mentioned in the interview . from work that i have been doing on the integration of the swaption volatility surface on the whole yield curve interest rate model itm and otm instruments can be included in both the callibration , pricing and hedging .  i look forward hearing back from you soon and particularly to the opportunity of us cooperating .  best regards  joao",0

"Subject: capital book  to further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing enron america ' s velocity of capital and associated return on invested capital , we have decided to create a capital book . the capital book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by joe deffner . the purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within enron americas , with any form of capital requirement , are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge .  the previous numbers used in the business plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets . therefore , on any assets currently held within each business area , the capital charge will remain at 15 % . internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating business unit subject to the internal ownership policy outlined below .  the cost of capital associated with all transactions in enron americas will be set by joe . this process is separate and apart from the current rac process for transactions which will continue unchanged .  capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15 % . transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15 % across the board charge . transactions which are structured off balance sheet , but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on enron america ' s overall credit capacity .  on transactions that deploy capital through the trading books , the capital book will take a finance reserve on each transaction , similar to the way the credit group takes a credit reserve . this finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction . as noted above , the capital book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost .  by sending market - based capital pricing signals internally , enron america ' s sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization .  questions regarding the capital book can be addressed to :  joe deffner 853 - 7117  alan quaintance 345 - 7731",0

"" rather than go  through all the  hassles they [ dynegy ] had at ferc with the 1998 - 99 package , they let  someone else do  all the work this time and then came in late with a higher bid . that way  no one can  complain that the procedure was tainted . after all , dynegy has quite a  few power plants  in california to keep fueled , and all of their current ft on el paso  expires at the end of  this year . of course , they still could be thwarted if the original  negotiated customer  matches their bid . it may all sound kind of machiavellian but sort of  makes sense . "" other  sources heavily discounted the chances of dynegy being the new high  bidder , pointing out  that the company made significantly less than expected this year because  san  juan / border basis differentials narrowed significantly . a dynegy source  indicated that the  company was involved in the bidding and lost to duke in the first round .  regardless of what happens next year , a marketer noted that the southern  california  border / san juan basis spread continues to compress as socal gas  withdraws from  storage and east - of - california utilities exercise their peaking  contracts because of cold  weather in the rockies and elsewhere in the west . from a december index  spread of 29  cents , the border / basin gap was down to about 18 cents wednesday , she  said .",0

"Subject: re : the consultant ' s model for gary hickerson ' s group  the model is supposed to be a real option model to capture the value of  power plants of gencos . it is to give trader a better insight as to whether  the  market is overvaluing / undervaluing certain genco stocks , and trader can  act accordingly . i ' m still trying to find out how trader is supposed to use  it .  modeling details :  the model takes in all gencos ' locational power forward prices and fuel  forward  prices , and uses garch model to simulate one year daily prices , and then  uses a hourly profile to convert them into hourly prices . garch model  parameters  are estimated by the consultant using and separate model and  are updated twice a year , and it does not matter whether the simulation starts  in january or september .  using these prices , it will determine whether a unit at a particular location  will be dispatched  or not depending on a ) spread of power and fuel prices , and b ) whether the  start - up  cost can be recovered during 8 operation hours . the unit can be dispatched at  minimum and peak levels . fixed o & m , sox and nox ( i don ' t know what the last  two stand for )  are taken into consideration .  with the simulated dispatch schedule , the model calculates the value that can  be generated  by this unit , then sums it up across all units .  the final value is the average of 100 simulations . and it takes about 16  hours to run for about  200 units .  after our conversation , the consultant promised to look into a ) how to make  the model more flexible ,  say , to allow a different time horizon , b ) reduce spreadsheet overhead by  doing calculation one  unit a time and not saving all the intermediate information ( as of now it  saves everything  on the spreadsheet ) .  assuming the garch process is modelled correctly , i believe the methodology  is ok , though  it does not capture most of the optionality .  my concerns are :  whether the price processes are modelled correctly . i have to get more  details before making  any conclusion .  100 simulations are way too few . unless we convert the algorithm to c , i  don ' t see how spreadsheet  can handle more simulations . i guess that ' s why they contact us . but again ,  if enron ' s buying the  model from the consulting company , why should enron do their job for them ?  how trader ' s going to use the model output . for this i phoned jeff ( the  associate who initiated all  these ) and am still waiting for his returning call . a related questions why  the model horizon is one year .  we can either  oversee the conversation , but not doing actual coding for them .  or  redo the model for them . ( the problem still remains that how trader ' s going  to use the output ) . but  in view of the great wall of china separating the business units , should we  do it ?  as of now i have a simulation model taking start - up cost , fixed o & m , rump - up  delay into consideration .  it simulates monthly prices ( using gbm ) and takes 2 minutes 40 seconds to run  10 , 000 simulations for  one unit for ten years ( 120 time steps ) . it can use forward - forward vol and  incorporate seasonality into  it ( i understand this is debatable ) . ( one interesting observation is that  when using forward - forward vol  simulation , the standard deviation is about 0 . 5 % , while standard deviation  using forward vol is about  2 % . also , incorporating seasonality increases the value by about 1 . 6 % ) . since  most of the time - cost  occurs in price simulation , and we are to simulate about 20 price processes ,  i hope the full model  ( if we build it ) will take a couple of hours to run for 200 units . the main  task will be interfacing , i . e . ,  getting data from data base , and outputting the results . this is where i need  most help if i am to do it .  please advice the course of action . i am supposed to talk to michelle  cisneros today .  p . s . i never promised to oversee a programmer in our group ( see the message  below ) .  best ,  alex  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by alex huang / corp / enron on 01 / 05 / 2001 08 : 58  am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  jeff m gray  01 / 04 / 2001  to : gary . hickerson @ enron . com , michael . w . bradley @ enron . com ,  michelle . d . cisneros @ enron . com , jaime . gualy @ enron . com  cc : alex . huang @ enron . com , kskinner @ ftenergy . com , cseiple @ ftenergy . com  subject : fw : project timeline  ken and i worked up the following timeline and refined the trading  methodology a bit this morning . we also met with alex huang from vince ' s  group , and explained the model and coding tasks . ken and alex have arranged  to speak by phone on monday , and meanwhile alex is coordinating within the  research group . alex will oversee a programmer within his group , while  interfacing regularly with us .  1 / 4 kickoff  1 / 11 complete spreadsheet , table , and database structures ( rdi ) .  1 / 17 complete software coding for the pricemaker component of the model  ( rdi and enron research ) , and begin testing ( enron research ) .  1 / 22 complete software coding for the dispatch portion of the model ( rdi  and enron research ) , and begin testing ( enron research ) .  1 / 22 complete financial trader "" user "" interface , within the access  environment ( rdi ) .  1 / 22 complete collection and delivery of unverified generating - unit data from  rdi databases ( rdi ) . begin verification process ( rdi ) .  1 / 29 complete all charts and reports accessible from the user interface  ( rdi ) .  1 / 29 complete compilation of consensus ebitda forecasts for all operations  other than merchant generation ( enron financial trading ) .  2 / 9 complete code testing ( enron research ) .  2 / 9 deliver verified and quality - checked generating - unit data ( rdi ) .  2 / 9 complete the model , begin testing the trading methodology , and train  users .  2 / 16 finish training , testing , and final qc .  jeff",0

"Subject: 75 % reduction in road accidents  august , 2002  dear sir / madam ,  in case you have received this mail earlier , kindly ignore this mail . it may have  been re - sent to you by mistake . ours is not a mailing list and we have no intention of sending any regular mails to anybody .  we have devised a set of systems , which can reduce the damage caused to vehicles and deaths and injury caused to passengers and pedestrians in vehicular accidents by more than  seventy - five percent  we have already filed and are in process of filing further , multiple and appropriate disclosure documents , provisional patent applications at the united states patent & trademarks office ( uspto ) , and also applications under the patent co - operation treaty at world intellectual property organization ( wipo ) at geneva .  there is absolutely no doubt that our idea is new and innovative . moreover , we are very confident and very sure that this will help reducing / minimizing human suffering to a very large extent . there is no doubt that the product devised by us will change the face of the earth forever . brief details relating to our product are detailed in the annexures under the following headings :  statistics advantages  options  economics  we are looking for the followings :  01 . business consultancy and advice regarding the most viable , practical and profitable course of action under the circumstances and also consultancy on patents one person moderately injured every three seconds ; one person mildly injured every three seconds . )  ( c ) current yearly automobile sales worldwide - more than 1000 billion us $ .  ( d ) number of automobiles worldwide - more than 1000 billion pieces  ( e ) daily loss caused due to vehicular accidents worldwide  more than 2 billion us $ per day .  ( 2 % of the worldwide gross national product of more than 36500 billion us $ = more than 730 us $ per year = more than 2 billion us $ per day )  theadvantages of the technology developed by us :  a . the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of auto - insurance . this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles . accordingly , the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction . additionally , because of saving of lives , the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantially .  b . as per the who studies and projections , road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today . it is projected by who that by the year 2020 they will occupy the number three positions , next only to heart disease and depression .  by introduction of this technology , we are sure that this will not happen . on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death , in the year 2020 at all .  c . this technology will therefore , make all vehicles cheaper and safer . not only will the cost be reduced , safety which is priceless in itself , will also be greatly enhanced .  as and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted , the life of the patent will be 20 years . even at the current levels , with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death , there is a daily loss of two billion us $ . even at the present level , over a period of twenty years , without any interest and without any compounding , this loss works out to be :  2 billion us $ x 365 days x 20 years - 14 , 600 billion us $ .  d . our technology will ensure that at least seventy - five percent of the above losses are prevented . such figure works out to be more that 10 , 000 billion us $ . it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level . as per the future projections , the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase . hence , the figure is likely to be increase very substantially . in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure further .  e . at the current levels , more than 1 . 2 million persons are dying every year due to road accidents . even at the current rates , more than 24 million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years ( i . e . life of the patent , when granted ) . besides , at the current levels .  3 . 2 million people are injured every year . in the next twenty years , the number of people injured due to road accident , will therefore be more than half a billion .  f . if we add to that the personal , physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents . the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings , are all unmeasurable in quantities , presently known to human kind .  g . considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove , it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity , computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankind .  h . the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that , in the very near future , the use of this technology will become unavoidable . it should and will become mandatory by law , to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a pre - requisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in future .  i . as described hereinabove ; this technology and its utility are incomparable , outthought of , and unheard of till date . it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures . in future , it can and will be applied to other mode of transport , like aircrafts and trains also .  . among other things , we have the following options available to us : - options  available to us : -  a - outright sale  ( a ) immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration .  ( b ) further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications , before taking steps as outlined in "" a "" .  the process ( b ) will obviously increase the realization in terms of price .  b - licencing options  i ) new vehicles - granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles , individually or collectively , all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis .  ii ) conversion of existing vehicles - to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than 1000 billion vehicles all over the world .  c - combined options  a collaborative arrangement with some private and / or government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a pre - decided sharing ( partnership ) arrangement .  the economics of the project will be as follows : -  1 ) in case any / all processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design of new vehicles and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs , the cost escalation may not be more than 5 % to 8 % , and the safety and the protection will be ten times ( more than ) the price escalation . hence , drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalation .  2 ) in case , the existing vehicles are modified , the cost involved will be approximately 10 % to 15 % of the value of the vehicle .  but partial modifications at a lower cost , which will give partial protection , may also be carried out . as a thumb rule , the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection provided .  3 ) in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire , the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable , as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protective .  4 ) there are more than 1000 billion motor vehicles in the world at present . besides there are an unspecified number of non - motorized ehicles .  5 ) almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree . the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there from .  6 ) among the motorised vehicles , the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out , but over all , some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiency .  7 ) even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of 300 us $ per vehicle , the conversion industry works out to be worth 3 , 00 , 000 billion us $ .  8 ) realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety , it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting date .  9 ) as pointed hereinabove , the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to , in the range of 1 , 00 , 000 billion us $ per year over the next three years .  10 ) alternatively , considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world , conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition . for such conversion , licenses can be granted on - line , on receipt of on - line payments . in that case , different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size , carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehicle .  11 ) in case , licensing is done , the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the end - user , as per his circumstances and needs . however , piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensing .  12 ) it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles , unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created . this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned . the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend and / or estimate .  p . s .  1 ) some of the figures have been rounded off but generally the figures are correct .  2 ) we have tried to keep this communication brief and to the point . more details , including website references are available with us and can be provided , if required .

( of course ,  because of the $ 15 , 000 / year limit , i have to spread my gifts over several  years in order to get the total amount matched by enron . )  sherry benton , the librarian in spearman just called and gave me the great  news that the $ 20 , 000 in community donations has been achieved . in fact , i  expect that the total community number will come to almost $ 25 , 000 once all  of the donations are received .  in order to recognize our part in all this , the mayor of the town is planning  to declare october 17 th as "" stinson gibner and enron day "" in spearman , and  they would like to have some public ceremony to bestow this recognition .  there will be coverage by the local radio station and newspaper and ,  possibly , by the amarillo newspaper as well .  they are asking if a representative from enron ( other than myself ) would be  interested in coming to spearman for this event . please let me know if you  or anyone else would be interested in doing this . spearman is about a 90  minute drive north from the airport in amarillo , and it is possible to get  there and back to houston on the same day .  thanks ,  stinson gibner  x 34748  p . s . is there any possibility of getting a one time raise on the $ 15 , 000 / year  matching cap so that i can have $ 40 , 000 matched in just two years instead of  three ?  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by stinson gibner / hou / ect on 09 / 20 / 2000  02 : 01 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  stinson gibner  05 / 05 / 2000 11 : 47 am  to : cindy olson / corp / enron @ enron  cc :  subject : thanks  cindy ,  i just received notification of enron ' s match of my $ 8000 donation to the  hansford county library in spearman , texas . ( all old pipeline hands know  spearman because both northern natural and transwestern pipelines run near by  the city . )  you may be interested to know what i am trying to accomplish there . the  library is one of the few independent public libraries in the state of texas  as it is owned neither by the county nor city . it ' s budget is met through a  combination of city , county , and private contributions . a big part of their  income comes from the "" thrift shop , "" spearman ' s version of the blue bird  circle . in order to help the library continue to provide quality services  to the community ( our library in spearman , population 3000 , is by all  accounts much better than the one in nearby perryton , population 15000 ) , i  am trying to help the library establish an endowment fund . we have set a  goal of raising $ 100 , 000 over the next 3 years . with enron ' s matching , i am  planning to provide about $ 80 , 000 of that amount with the other $ 20 , 000  coming from contributions from others in the local community .  i am also investigating if the library can get any type of matching grant  from other foundations , but it looks like most prefer to fund specific  projects rather than put funds towards endowments . let me know if you have  any suggestions for us .  thanks ,  stinson  x 34748",0

"Subject: re : ebs var transaction policy  i have two things biting me .  first is time . i need to turn a draft for hannon and rice asap . so , the  value of a deliberative approach to coming up with a v @ r policy will quickly  evaporate if we take 2 weeks to study what the policy should say .  second , i have a unique situation . our concept of v @ r is really unlike the  rest of enron ' s today . what happens today is that network engineers  unilaterally make decisions about deployment , configuration and other matters  which effect the longs and shorts of our asset / contract portfolio that they  view strictly from a network operating standpoint .  a good example was a decision to move our primary terapop ( three large  servers storing 165 gigabytes each ) from portland to la . the servers are  already in place and purchased , so no capital was involved . but the  decision has huge ramifications on the future la / new york and other bandwidth  usage , and that cost money . now it could be that the la / new york cost is  cheaper than the portland / new york cost , the whole point is no one knows .  what our "" value - at - risk "" policy attempt to corral is these types of decisions  and put them into the hands of the risk management group , where the decision  will be made with at least some economic work behind it .  i really see the ebs v @ r policy to be misnamed , since we don ' t really have  the math done to calc v @ r . it really is a volumetric - based control policy  that says you can ' t make network changes over xx amount of megabytes ( a  storage measure ) or oc - 3 equivalents ( a bandwidth measure ) without risk  management making or approving the decision . i do believe that with  research ' s help , we can in time actually calculate the v @ r impact of such  decisions . at that time , the policy should be modified to set metrics based  on the v @ r calculations .  so if you have an open enough mind to let us co - op your word for a minute ,  we need to start turning the minds of the network industry people into  thinking about their decisions as having value effects . said directly ,  kevin hannon has given me authority to write a policy to move control over  significant network changes from the field to the trading floor , and i am  going to issue something now to effectuate that . . . . . .  so . . . i really want your views on what we are doing , but thought you needed  some flavor and an sense of the urgency . if you can weigh in , do so  quickly . . . . .  barry pearce  06 / 30 / 00 04 : 47 am  to : john echols / enron communications @ enron communications , lou casari / enron  communications @ enron communications  cc :  subject : re : ebs var transaction policy  positive . . . .  - - - - - forwarded by barry pearce / enron communications on 06 / 30 / 00 04 : 49 am  - - - - -  ted murphy @ ect  06 / 29 / 00 11 : 33 am  to : barry pearce / enron communications @ enron communications @ enron  cc :  subject : re : ebs var transaction policy  barry ,  conceptually , i see no reason that a process like this can not be  implemented . in some way we have attempted to do so through the enron corp  transaction approval process ( tap ) . i have forwarded to john a copy of this ,  along with the risk management policy . i ' ll let him share with you if ok ( i  really don ' t want to act as the firm ' s in - house kinko ' s !

"Subject: urgent contact  from the desk of : dr tom eke .  e - mail : dr _ tomeke @ spinfinder . com  lagos - nigeria .  attn :  request for urgent business relationship .  it is with my profound dignity that i write you this  very important  and highly confidential letter . first , i must  solicit your strictest  confidentiality in this transaction . this is by  virtue of its nature  as being utterly confidential and "" top secret "" .  though i know that a  transaction of this magnitude will make any one  apprehensive and  worried , considering the fact that we have not met  each other before ,  but i am assuring you that all will be well at the  end of the day . we  have decided to contact you by email due to the  urgency of this  transaction , as we have been reliably informed that  it will take at  least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal  post to reach you ,  so we decided it is best using the e - mail , which is  quicker and also  to enable us meet up with the second quater payment  for the year  2000 .  however , let me start by introducing myself properly  to you . i  am dr . tom eke , a director general in the department  of petroleum  resources ( d . p . r ) and i presently head the contract  award panel incharge  of contract awards and payment approvals . i came to  know of you in my search for a reliable and  reputable person to  handle a very confidential business transaction  which involves the  transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account  requiring  maximum confidence . i and my colleagues are top  officials of the  federal government contract award panel . our duties  include evaluation , vetting , approval for payment of  contract jobs  done for the d . p . r e . t . c . in order to commence this  business we  solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer  into your account  the said funds . the source of this funds is as  follows : in the second  quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to  review and award  contracts to the tune of us $ 400 million us dollars  to a group of five  firms for the supply construction and installation  of oil pipe lines  in warri and port harcourt . during this process my  colleagues and i  decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately  over - inflate the  total contract sum from us $ 400 million to us $ 431  million united  states dollars with the main intention of sharing  the remaining sum  of us $ 31 miilion amongst ourselves .  the federal government of nigeria has since the  second quater of  year 2001 approved the sum of us $ 431 million for us  as the contract sum ,  and the sum of us $ 400 million has also been paid to  the foreign companies  concerned as contract entitlements for the various  contracts done , but  since the companies are entiltled to us $ 400 million  dollars only , we are  now left with us $ 31 million dollars balance in the  account which we intend to  disburse amongst ourselves , but by virtue of our  positions as civil  servants and members of this panel , we cannot do  this by ourselves ,  as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau  ( civil service  laws ) from opening and / or operating foreign accounts  in our names  while still in government service , making it  impossible for us to  acquire the money in our names right now . i have  therefore , been  delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my  colleagues in the  panel to look for an overseas partner into whose  account we would  transfer the sum of us $ 31 million . hence we are  writing you this  letter . my colleagues and i have agreed that if you  or your company  can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our  behalf , you or your  company will retain 20 % of the total amount ( us $ 31  million ) , while  70 % will be for us ( officials ) and the remaining 10 %  will be used in  offsetting all debts / expenses and taxes incurred  both local and  foreign in the cause of this transfer . needless to  say , the trust  reposed on you at this juncture is enormous . in  return we demand your  complete honesty and trust .  you must however note that this transaction will be  strictly based  on the following terms and conditions as we have  stated below ;  a ) our conviction of your transparent honesty and  diligence  b ) that you would treat this transaction with utmost  secrecy and confidentiality  c ) that you will not ask for more share or try to  sit on the funds once it is under  your custody , or any form of blackmail .  d ) that upon receipt of the funds you will release  the funds as instructed  by us after you have removed your share of 20 % from  the total amount .  please , note that this transaction is 100 % legal and  risk free and we hope to conclude  this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days  from the date  of receipt of the necessary requirements from you .  we are looking  forward to doing business with you and solicit your  total confidentiality  in this transaction . there is no cause for alarm . i  give you my word that you  are completely safe in doing business with us .  transactions like this  have been successfully carried out in the past by  most government  executives . here in my country there is great  economic and political  disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant  and the order of  the day , thus explaining why you might have heard  stories of how  money is been taken out of nigeria , this is because  everyone is  making desperate attempts to secure his or her  future , so that when  we retire from active service we donot languish in  poverty . i will  explain more to you when i have heard from you .  please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using  the above e - mail address .  i will bring you into the complete picture of this  pending business  transaction when i have heard from you and also  receive your  confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me  fax to you all  necessary information you need to know about our  pending business  transaction . i will also send to you my private  telephone and fax  numbers where you can always reach me . your urgent  response will be  highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds  under the second  quarter of the year 2002 . thank you and god bless .  yours faithfully ,  dr . tom eke .  n . b . please be informed that this business  transaction is 100 % legal  and completely free from drug money or money  laundering . this is a  complete legitimate business transaction .  - -",1

"Subject: refined products line - - north american markets - cera alert : decem  ber 15 , 2000  cera alert : december 15 , 2000  title : refined products line - - north american markets  cera knowledge areas : refined products  us margin highlights  * responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels ,  us gulf coast unleaded gasoline margins versus wti fell by $ 2 . 26 per barrel  to average $ 1 . 45 per barrel during november . gasoline margins have returned  to a historically normal range after spending the summer of 2000 at  exceptionally high values . cera expects gasoline margins to wti to average  $ 2 . 75 per barrel during the first quarter of the new year , $ 1 . 16 per barrel  lower than this year ' s first quarter average .  * high sulfur no . 2 fuel oil differentials with wti dropped slightly ,  averaging $ 5 . 97 per barrel in november . despite the drop of $ 0 . 37 per barrel  from october ' s average , fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented  values - $ 4 . 20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $ 3 . 46 per barrel greater  that the previous five - year average . for the first quarter of 2001 , cera  anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record  high level of $ 4 . 75 per barrel in the first quarter .  * jet / kerosene differentials versus wti rose $ 0 . 63 per barrel from the  october average , reaching a whopping $ 8 . 59 per barrel in november . in  correspondence with the distillate market , jet / kerosene margins are at  historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight  fundamentals . cera expects jet / kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the  first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the  holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of  $ 5 . 75 per barrel .  * margins for us gulf coast 1 % sulfur residual fuel dropped by $ 2 . 15 per  barrel , reaching $ 3 . 99 per barrel below wti during november . despite the  recent widening of differentials , cera expects soaring natural gas prices to  support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter  months . residual fuel differentials are expected to average $ 2 . 50 per barrel  below wti during the first quarter of next year , at the high end of the  historical range .  us demand highlights  * apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0 . 5 million  barrels per day ( mbd ) from the october level , reaching 8 . 36 mbd for the four  weeks ending december 8 . demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last  year largely because y 2 k concerns helped inflate december demand a year ago .  cera anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder  temperatures arrive , averaging 8 . 08 mbd during the first quarter of 2001 .  * reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3 . 94  mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 , over 7 percent greater than this  time last year . this represents a slight increase of about 0 . 05 million  barrels ( mb ) from the end - october level of 3 . 90 mb , but still a record high  level for early december . with support from low home heating oil inventories ,  particularly in the northeast , distillate demand has been very strong during  the fall of 2000 . cera expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter  months , averaging 3 . 79 mb during the first quarter of next year .  * apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the october level  to reach 1 . 68 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 . despite the decline ,  apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year - ago level . the  relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel  distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to  help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals . cera expects the  demand for jet fuel to average 1 . 81 mb during the fourth quarter .  * reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0 . 87 mbd for the four weeks  ending december 8 , a decline of about 0 . 09 mbd from the october average and a  slight increase over the november level . demand for residual fuel is  currently 11 percent greater than last year , and surging natural gas prices  are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout  the winter . residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0 . 85 to 0 . 9 mbd  range during the first quarter of 2001 .  us inventory highlights  * primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196 . 5 mb , increasing  almost 10 mb from the end - october value . responding to rising stock levels  and declining apparent demand , forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to  23 . 5 days for the four weeks ending december 8 . forward supply is 2 . 5 percent  below last year ' s level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the  past eight years - although cera still believes coverage is currently  sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter . however , cera is  looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and  production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the  start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year .  * distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of  october at 29 . 2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 .  despite record high apparent demand , strong refinery production levels helped  boost primary distillate inventories slightly , to 115 . 3 mb for this period .  primary stocks are 16 percent below last year ' s level at this time and at  their lowest historical level ever . although stocks are low , cera does not  anticipate shortages to occur this winter . assuming normally cold weather ,  refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting  demand requirements - albeit at a high price .  * jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage , to  reach 25 . 7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 . this  moves jet fuel coverage above the 23 . 5 to 25 days ' supply range that it had  been in for the past four months . the rise of just under 1 day in forward  supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand . jet inventories  and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull  from tight distillate markets strengthen , but supplies are expected to be  adequate for the winter .  * inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply  from october , reaching 41 . 7 days of forward supply during the four weeks  ending december 8 . the increase in coverage was a temporary response to a  drop in demand and an increase in stocks . with demand expected to strengthen  because of colder weather and high gas prices , cera looks for inventories and  coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks .  * * end * *  this cera alert will be available in pdf format within 24 hours .  this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information  from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

"Subject: california update 5 / 4 / 01  if you have any questions , please contact kristin walsh at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 .  bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack of support  sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance / bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline . any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart . according to sources , both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis . the democratic caucus is reportedly "" unwilling to fight "" for davis . many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that , once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund , davis would "" double dip "" into the fund . clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor . however , it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place . additionally , some generator sources have reported that some of the long - term power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very difficult .  the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would "" eat "" the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8 billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor ' s plan for handling the crisis , including the details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they will support the bond issuance to go forward .  currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ; ab 8 x and ab 31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen , currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen ' s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) .  according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature , republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued . other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally , lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan .  key points of the bridge financing  initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b  lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b  lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b  bear stearns $ 625 m  tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ; $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax - exempt  projected interest rate : taxable rate 5 . 77 %  tax - exempt rate 4 . 77 %  current projected  blended ir : 5 . 38 %  maturity date : august 29 , 2001  for more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510  bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time  the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis .  socal edison and bankruptcy  at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash .  the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan ) stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers , then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments .",0

"Subject: gas prices  vince -  1 . we can detect "" hoarding "" of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against  the actual inflow .  2 . we can detect "" market power "" by dissociating the seller from the buyer ,  distinguishing between the physical "" cost "" in gas to run the generators and  the transmission cost in dollars , i . e . the basis .  3 . ( as you noted ) we can detect "" storage "" as the difference between inflow  and consumption .  it appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model  of gas prices : flow rates at interconnects ( from telemetry ) and spot - market  prices . there is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing  capacity , as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts . the dynamics of gas  prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for  the weather , as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors :  hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas . we can "" calibrate "" the  price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage , and the price  elasticities of demand for transmission , as well as the extent of hoarding ,  from the two sets of numbers mentioned : flows and prices . what the basis  trader needs to understand are the incentives , and disincentives , for storage  and capacity - hoarding , in terms of the calibrated price - elasticities , and  each of these are as - if exotic call options at the consumption hub . finally ,  flows are "" explained "" by the model , and can be imputed from prices if  necessary , resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of  the weather .  i believe the problem is quite tractable , and i would like to proceed with a  model .  clayton",0

"Subject: option pricing discrepancy for j . c . penny transaction  amitava and seksan have identified the source of the discrepancy between the  option prices calculated by the credit - reserve model and the stand - alone  spreadsheet model used in deal pricing . the discrepancy can be traced to  differences in input variables of the two models and not to any algorithmic  differences .  the options being priced are a strip of options on monthly instruments . the  credit reserve simulation program calculates the time to expiration by  assuming that the option expires on first day of the contract month of the  underlying contract , which is a very reasonable assumption .  the stand - alone option pricing spreadsheet allows specification of the option  expiration date independent of the contract month of the underlying . in the  jc penney transaction , the monthly options were assumed to expire in the  middle of the contract month , when in reality the underlying monthly  contracts expire before the start of their respective contract months . the  stand - alone spreadsheet model allows such specifications and it is up to the  user to ascertain that the expiration dates entered are legal . at present ,  seksan is ascertaining that the option contracts involved are in deed monthly  options and not a strip of daily options , in which case we would require  estimates of intramonth volatilities for both the spreadsheet model and the  credit reserve model .  regards ,  rabi de",0

"Subject: just fyi  vince ,  please see below some of the ideas being bounced , fyi . please keep this  confidential .  the unused capacity in maharashtra should be dispatched on a merchant basis ,  on behalf of mseb to any customers outside mseb ' s current purview . i would  like us to look at the whole issue as one of mseb ' s poor credit , and hence (  as jeff pointed out on the call ) , one where we need to identify all deep  pockets in and out of maharashtra .  secondly , there is ( as shubh and i had pointed out ) the ability to evacuate  about 700 - 1000 mw to customers other than mseb . the challege is - at what  price , and in coordination with which agencies . as always , in india your  greatest challenge will be in dealing with govt . agencies .  another point to consider is that in - all we have about 5 - 7 customers  identified . will all the customers we have earmarked bite ? ? ? this is the  reason why systems need to be set up with a bulletin board on pricing 10 - 15  day power on the screens of the different sebs we can connect up with . this  also substantially gets around the credit quality issue , as this would be an  arrangement akin to cash - and - carry . i see a lot of hope for such a  strategy . i do not see much hope for a strategy of selling blocks of power  to either ntpc or ptc . i would agree however , that we not put all our eggs  in one basket , and hence you could designate a team to look into the ntpc  sale issue inparallel .  in order to set up the trading sytems , however , we need to start by the end  of ql 2001 , and just start doing small deals where we break even , simply to  test the waters and introduce liquidity into the market .  hand - in - hand with this we need a fuel risk management strategy , as i have  been pushing for . for this to happen , we need to get the special import  licence reinstated . if that is not possible , we need to lobby with the  highest authorities within govt . and rbi to allow for hedging , irrespective  of whether we have an sil . the discussions being held with ioc are therefore  very important in this regard , and i am going to get anshuman and mukesh  involved with the same .  finally , i do not see much hope for your strategy of asking ene management  for $ 75 million to build transmission lines in a country where the regulatory  framework on transmission access is even less defined and understood than the  generation side of the equation . i would refrain from stating this in any  senior management forum until we are able to clearly demonstrate the  cost - benefit of this . i have some ideas on that side which i need to develop  further .  regards ,  sandeep .",0

"Subject: lng by rail  vince ,  i was thinking about the type of things you could be talking to jeff shankman  about , in the dabhol lng context . it occurred to me that one way to collect  on regas charges , and still find alternate cutomers for gas is through the  railways .  some time back , i had looked into the possiblility of transporting lng by  train . apparently , technology exists wherein lng can be put into cryogenic  containers that can be trucked as well as the same containers being loaded  from trucks to train bogies . i believe this maybe a way to earn some monies  with lng by developing just such a market in india for commercial customers .  it is pertinent to note that the konkan rail line is just about 1 hr . 45  minutes from the dabhol plant . trucks from dabhol could carry lng to the  rail line at guhagar from where it could travel up and down the west coast of  india . if we target end - consumers directly , we could easily sell at retail  type prices , and build in a large margin , even if the volumes disposed are  relatively smaller . ( the alternative fuel for most of these establishments  is diesel or naphtha which is highly priced , and mostly trucked along  roads , increasing costs ) . the end aim is to keep income targets in india , so  that the analysts do not have a field day with the stock .  hence keeping activity up in india , and showing that solutions exist , will  keep stock price buoyed . we could explore this idea if it appeals !  regards ,  sandeep .",0

"Subject: re : equity investment fair value in turkey  john ,  it seems to me that using a risk - free rate is not appropriate . i shall  elaborate on my  position and send you a longer message this afternoon ( my time ) .  vince  enron capital & trade resources corp . - europe  from : john bottomley 06 / 19 / 2000 05 : 55 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect , dale surbey / lon / ect @ ect  subject : equity investment fair value in turkey  vince ,  john sherriff recommended that i contact you regarding an interesting ( and  potentially contentious ) option valuation issue we are currently dealing with  in london . we hold longish term options in a private company in turkey which  is currently seeking to ipo . the issue we are discussing with rac is which  discount rate ( i . e . , risk - free ? and if so turkish or us ? ) should we use to  value these options  first , some additional information .  option characteristics :  - - 116 , 000 options ( representing 9 % of the company )  - - term : minimum of 3 years but possibly longer - - still being renegotiated  - - strike price : 20 % below the upcoming ipo price ( either priced in us $ or  turkish lire )  we currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $ 118 . 75  per option but 34 , 800 expire on july 15 , 2000 with the remainder expiring on  december 15 , 2000 . the company ' s investment bankers ( abn / amro rothchilds )  are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at  $ 118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $ 300 million . due  to such a large "" valuation gap "" , they originally encouraged us to exercise  all of the options by the end of june ( ipo target date in late sept / early  oct ) . our counter - proposal is to "" swap "" instrinsic value for time value by  repricing the options strike higher while extending their term .  we are currently negotiating with rac the most appropriate discount rate to  use to value the options . we are arguing that the us risk free is the most  appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company ' s  historical senior debt cost ( 18 % ) is the more appropriate number to use  ( although admit that this is not justifiable - - only a proxy )  a few key points :  - - rac is valuing the options via crystal ball simulations such that this "" to  be negotiated "" discount rate is used to calculate the pv of the future  options intrinsic value in 3 years  ( i . e . , for black - scholes , a higher discount rate yields a higher value but  the opposite is true using crystal ball simulation )  - - the model simulates both an ipo / no ipo case and in the case of no ipo we  have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17 % return  - - the model assigns a 30 % illiquidity discount  - - in the simulated cases where the options are out - of - the - money , we  obviously do not exercise .  we understand that for black - scholes option valuation , one needs to be able  to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and  the risk free in order for the valuation to hold . and here is where we reach  our difficulty : since the company doesn ' t currently trade on a public market  and since equity futures do not exist for turkish equities , rac is arguing  that a us risk free is not appropriate to use . our argument is that the  non - ipo scenario , a 30 % illiquidity discount and a us $ based option  volatility are already in the factored into the simulation . as such , we feel  rac ' s approach is double counting .  if you managed to get through the above , your a patient man ! i ' ll give you a  call today or tomorrow after you ' ve had a chance to digest the information .  regards ,  john bottomley",0

"Subject: japanese power market  another article i thought you might find interesting .  regards ,  eugenio  review of energy policies kicks off  asahi shimbun  april 25 , 2000  a government advisory panel on monday embarked on a  comprehensive review of energy - related policies .  ` ` we want to come up with feasible policies and at the  same time clearly present reasons for those policies , ' '  yoichi kaya , a professor emeritus at the university of  tokyo , told a meeting of the coordination subcommittee  under the advisory committee for energy , an advisory  panel to minister of international trade and industry  takashi fukaya . kaya chairs the subcommittee .  the nuclear development policy , including the  government ' s goal for building new nuclear power plants ,  is expected to be a focus of the discussions .  a spate of nuclear accidents have made construction of  plants increasingly difficult , and the nation ' s power  suppliers have reduced the number of new nuclear power  plants expected to be in operation by fiscal 2010 from 20  to 13 .  the subcommittee , set up for the first time in about 10  years , is made up of about 30 members , and members of  anti - nuclear nongovernmental organizations have been  included for the first time .  some members told monday ' s meeting that the  government must stop taking the nuclear development  policy for granted and seriously look into the possibility  of introducing renewable energy , such as wind and solar  power .  also on the agenda will be energy saving measures .  energy consumption in the residential and commercial  sector , made up of homes and offices , and in the  transportation sector , which includes cars and trucks , has  almost doubled over the past 25 years .  at monday ' s meeting , many members stressed the need  to change public consciousness toward the use of  energy .  miti plans to present studies on how life would be  affected by compulsory energy saving measures such as  automatically turning off air conditioners at certain  temperatures or vehicle engines when they are idle .",0
